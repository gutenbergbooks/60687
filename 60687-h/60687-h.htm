<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The publishers of this interesting volume do not conceive that it
requires an elaborate introduction to the reading public. Some brief
remarks, however, may not be inappropriate as a preface to T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> M<span class="smcapa">AGICIAN'S</span> O<span class="smcapa">WN</span> B<span class="smcapa">OOK</span>,
since the "black art," as in lessen lightened
ages the practice of all these innocent and interesting feats was termed,
is not yet as popularly understood in this country as it is abroad.
There is a charm in legerdemain, or sleight of hand, that all, whether
young or old, can readily appreciate. There is a mystery in it that
piques the understanding as well as provokes the curiosity of the
spectator. If the trick be executed with address, it excites our admiration;
and the simpler it appears, the more it engages our fancy and
fascinates our attention. And it is not only when we are mystified in
public, cajoled in great saloons, and in the presence of crowds, that
these effects are developed. They are called forth by the performances
even of some humble artist in the family circle, whose ingenuity of
mind has enabled him to gather up the more available of these practical
puzzles. It would seem, therefore, a useful thing to place this
source of harmless amusement within the reach of all who can relish
its eccentricities, and instead of leaving it in the hands of "professors,"
as a pecuniary speculation, to enable the domestic group to master and
enjoy it in all its ever-varying phases of novelty and gratification. To
do this is what the publishers propose in the issue of this volume;
and they flatter themselves, that if carefully studied, it will prepare the
Young Conjuror to convert the parlor, at any desirable moment, into
a place of genuine entertainment for himself and his companions, and
ample repay him for the little time and thought he may devote to the
acquisition of the necessary skill and dexterity.</p>

<p>Sleight of hand, magic, necromancy, &amp;c., are all terms of art
applicable to the same series of performances. The parlor student,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
therefore, once familiar with the general principles upon which these
"experiments" are effected, will find little difficulty in comprehending
at a glance, notwithstanding all the show of gorgeous paraphernalia
and auxiliary machinery employed, the <em>modus operandi</em> of every one
of them he may witness in public. This will be a new source of
pleasure to him, independent of his ability to turn "Conjuror" on
his own account at home. Nor can we well conceive of any rational
objection likely to be urged against a kind of knowledge, so unimpeachable
in its nature, and so mirth provoking in its results. Acting
Charades are common, even among the most fastidious families.
Enigmas and puzzles, in pantomime and speech, afford innoxious amusement
to thousands. The publishers only consider T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> M<span class="smcapa">AGICIAN'S</span> O<span class="smcapa">WN</span> B<span class="smcapa">OOK</span>
a new addition to the current list of entertainments of that
character; for what is a sleight of hand feat but an enigma placed
before the spectator for solution? What is a trick in "natural magic"
but a puzzle repeated to those who behold it, each one of whom is
tacitly expected to guess how it is accomplished, while the little
practitioner only holds the key to the mystery? In truth, the parlor
needs some increase in its means of social amusement. The number
it embraces is extremely limited. They soon weary. This weariness
creates an appetite for outside attractions, not always wholesome, and
too often insidiously pernicious. T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> M<span class="smcapa">AGICIAN'S</span> O<span class="smcapa">WN</span> B<span class="smcapa">OOK</span> nicely
fills up, therefore, the void in the category of parlor recreations. It
may be made to present an ever-changing, always tempting, stay-at-home
inducement, and in this shape becomes a moral assistant of no
unimportant description, as well as the piquant source of good humored
bamboozlement.</p>

<p>In conclusion we would say, that the  T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> M<span class="smcapa">AGICIAN'S</span> O<span class="smcapa">WN</span> B<span class="smcapa">OOK</span> contains
a great variety of curious tricks and deceptions, many of which
have never before appeared in print, and for many of which the
publishers beg to acknowledge their indebtedness to Mr. John Wyman,
Junior, the celebrated magician, that gentleman having kindly
furnished clear and simple explanations to many of his most surprising
parlor feats and fancies.</p>

</div>

<p class="p6">INCLUDING SLEIGHT OF HAND, WITH OBJECTS OR CARDS, WITH AND
WITHOUT APPARATUS.</p>


<p>That there has been "Jugglery" in all ages of the world,
the pages of history abundantly prove. The ancient religions
of the heathen were mixed up with an extensive system
of legerdemain, and were, more or less, tissues of trickery.
Sleight of hand, tricks of the tongue by which the word
was kept to the ear, but broken to the hope, and various
miraculous deceptions, were the means by which the priests
of Egypt, Greece, and Rome used to subjugate mankind.
Happy ought we to be, in living in an age when humbug
of every kind is sure to meet exposure by the daylight
beams of truth.</p>

<p>The Eastern nations, from the earliest times, possessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
besides these religious jugglers, others who made a livelihood
by going from place to place, and performing various
tricks and feats by which the judgement was bewildered and
the reason bamboozled; and even now the performers of
the East infinitely exceed those of the West. In the Norman
times the juggler was termed jongleur, or joculator, and
united in one the minstrel, astrologer, and merry-andrew.
In the fourteenth century, he seems to have become more
entirely a performer of tricks and feats, and bore the name
of Tregetour. The tregetours were adepts at every kind
of sleight of hand, and by the assistance of machinery of
various kinds, deceived the eyes of the spectators, and produced
such illusions as were usually supposed to be the
effect of enchantment, for which reason they were frequently
ranked with sorcerers, magicians, and witches. Chaucer,
who no doubt had frequently an opportunity of seeing the
tricks exhibited by the tregetours of his time, says, "There
I sawe playenge jogelours, magyciens, trageteours, phetonysses,
charmeresses, old witches, and sorceresses;" and
the old poet goes on to say to them, "Sometimes they will
bring on the similitude of a grim lion, or make flowers
spring up as in a meadow; sometimes they cause a vine to
flourish, bearing white and red grapes, or show a castle built
with stone, and when they please, they cause the whole to
disappear:" and in another part of his work, he says:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"There saw I Coll Tregetour,</div>
  <div class="i0">Upon a table of sycamour,</div>
  <div class="i0">Play an uncouthe thynge to tell;</div>
  <div class="i0">I sawe hym cary a wyndemell,</div>
  <div class="i0">Under a walnot shale."&mdash;<cite>House of Fame</cite>, book iii.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The learned monarch, James I, was perfectly convinced
that these and other inferior feats exhibited by the tregetours
of his day, could only be performed by the agency
of the "old gentleman," whom it is not polite to name. The
profession had already fallen very low, and at the close of
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the performers were ranked
by the moral writers of that time, not only with ruffians,
blasphemers, thieves, and vagabonds, but also with Jews,
Turks, heretics, pagans, and sorcerers; and in more modern
times, by way of derision, the juggler was called a mocus-pocus,
or hocus-pocus, a term applicable to a pick-pocket,
or a common cheat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The following pages are not intended to make the young
reader either a cheat or a trickster; there is nothing, perhaps,
so utterly contemptible in every-day life, as trickery
and deception, and we would caution our young master
not to obtain by these amusements a love of deception, which
is only allowable in such feats of amusement, and which
is in no way culpable, when every one knows he is deceived.
But we would advise him strongly to cultivate in his own
mind the virtues of sincerity, straightforwardness, candor,
openness, and truth; to shun subterfuge and deception as
he would a venomous reptile; and to hate a lie as he would
hate that same old gentleman whom we were too polite to
name, and who is the father of it.</p>

<p>With this sage advice, we shall present a collection of
amusing conjuring tricks.</p>


<h3><a name="SLEIGHT_OF_HAND_TRICKS" id="SLEIGHT_OF_HAND_TRICKS"></a>SLEIGHT OF HAND.</h3>

<p>It is my intention, in the following pages, to lay more
stress upon those tricks which require no apparatus, than
upon those for which special apparatus, or the assistance
of a confederate, is required. No one is nearly so well
pleased by a trick whose essence evidently lies in the machinery,
while every one feels pleasure at seeing a sleight
of hand trick neatly executed. For my own part, I despise
all the numerous boxes, bottles, variegated covers,
and other gimcracks which are generally seen on a conjuror's
table; and I have never been so pleased with any
performer as with one who did not even require a table, but
pressed into his service articles borrowed from his audience,
as he stood before them, or walked among them. The spectators
should never be able to say, "Ah! the trick lies in
the box; he dares not show it to us!"</p>

<p>The following tricks have almost all been successfully
performed by myself, and have caused me some reputation
in the magic art. Some are my own invention:</p>


<p class="p6">1. THE FLYING DIME.</p>

<p>This trick must be frequently practiced before it is produced
in public.</p>

<p>Borrow two colored silk handkerchiefs from the company,
and have <em>three</em> dimes in your hand, but only show <em>two</em>, keeping
the other one firmly fixed against the first joint of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
second and third fingers. You must also have a fine needle
and thread stuck inside the cuff of your coat. Then take one
of the handkerchiefs, and put in <em>both</em> dimes, but pretend
that only <em>one</em> is in the handkerchief; then put the handkerchief
into a hat, leaving one corner hanging out. Now hold
up the <em>third</em> dime (which the spectators imagine is the
<em>second</em>), and ask one of the company to lay the second handkerchief
over it. You then ask him to hold the dime tight
between his finger and thumb, while you twist up the handkerchief.
While doing so, with both hands concealed under
the handkerchief, you pass a few stitches under the dime,
and replace the needle. This being done, spread one corner
of the handkerchief over the hand of the person who is still
holding the dime, and, taking hold of another corner, tell him
to drop the dime when you have counted three. At the
word "three," he lets go the dime, and you whisk the handkerchief
into the air, when the dime appears to have vanished,
but is really held in the handkerchief. You then tell
the astonished individual to draw the other handkerchief out
of the hat by the corner that is hanging out. The two dimes
are heard to fall into the hat, and every one is persuaded
that you have conjured one of the dimes out of a person's
hand, and sent it into the hat.</p>


<p class="p6">2. ANOTHER METHOD.</p>

<p>Perhaps the spectators may ask to see it again, or demand
to mark the dime. In this case, vary it as follows. Ask
some one (always choose the most incredulous of the party)
to mark a dime of his own, and give it you. Take the same
handkerchief, and give him the dime to hold that is already
enclosed in it, as in the last trick, dropping the marked dime
into the palm of your hand. Twist it up as before, and then
leave it entirely in his hands. Direct him to place it on
a table, and cover it with a basin or saucer. Ask him to
give you a cup or tumbler, and hold it under the table,
beneath the place where the saucer is. Then tell him to
knock three times on the saucer, and at the third knock let
the marked dime fall into the tumbler. Hand him the tumbler,
and while he is examining the dime to see if it is the
same one that he marked, take up the saucer, and shake out
the handkerchief that is lying under it, as in the last trick.
You must then return the handkerchief, and while you pretend
to be searching for the marks, draw out the thread that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
held the dime, and drop the coin into the palm of your hand,
taking care to rub between your finger and thumb the spot
where the threads had been, in order to eradicate the marks.
This variation seldom fails to confuse the company.</p>

<p>You must remember to keep talking the whole time, and
always try to make a joke, or otherwise to distract the
attention of the audience, while you are executing the
necessary changes.</p>


<p class="p6">3. THE BEADS AND STRINGS.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_005.jpg" width="200" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Ask some lady to lend you the beads off her bracelet, or
have by you five or six beads, which you may hand round
for examination. Then get some one
to cut two pieces of thin string of
equal length, and twist them about
your fingers, appearing to lay them
side by side, but in reality placing
them as in the figure, and then, by twisting them together
with apparent carelessness, the manner in which they are
arranged will not be seen, particularly if you keep the
point of junction hidden either by a finger, or by throwing
the shade of your hand upon it.</p>

<p>When the beads are returned, thread them all, taking care
to pass the center bead over the point of juncture. You
then bring the ends of the string 1 and 2 together, and tie
them so, doing the same with 3 and 4. Now give the tied
ends to two persons, directing them to hold them tight.
You need not fear that the beads will come off, even if they
pull hard. Then grasp the beads with both hands, directing
the holders to slacken the strings. You then, under
cover of the left hand, which is placed above the beads, slip
the center bead to one side, and draw out the two loops
which have been hidden in it. The beads will then easily
come off into your right hand. Tell the holders to pull hard,
which they will do, and the same moment remove your
hands, showing the empty strings, and all the beads in
your right hand. Then hand round the beads and strings
as before. Remember to rub out the marks in the strings
caused by the loops, before you remove your hands.</p>


<p class="p6">4. TO GET A RING OUT OF A HANDKERCHIEF.</p>

<p>Bend a piece of gold wire into the form of a ring, having
previously sharpened both ends. You have a real ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
made of the same piece of wire, and concealing the false
ring in the palm of your hand, offer the real one to be inspected.
When it is returned, borrow a handkerchief, and
while taking it from the lender, slip the real ring into your
left hand, and take the false one at its point of junction.
Throw the handkerchief over the ring, and give it to some
one to hold between his finger and thumb. Let the handkerchief
fall over it, and give a piece of string to a second
spectator, directing him to tie it round the handkerchief,
about two inches below the ring, so as to enclose it in a
bag, and tell him to do so as tightly as he can. While he
is doing this, take up your conjuring wand, a rod of some
hard wood, about eighteen inches long, and when the knot
is tied, step forward, passing the rod into your left hand,
taking care to slip over it the real ring, which has lain
concealed there. Slip your left hand to the center of the
rod, and direct each of the two persons to hold one end
of it in his right hand. Then tell the one who has the ring
and handkerchief, to lay them on your left hand, which you
immediately cover with your right. Then tell them to
spread another handkerchief over your hands, and to say
after you any nonsense that you like to invent.</p>

<p>While they are so doing, unbend the false ring, and draw
it through the handkerchiefs by one of its points, carefully
rubbing between the thumb and finger the place
where it came through. Hang the empty handkerchief
over the ring which is on the rod, and take away your hands,
which you exhibit empty, as you have stuck the false ring
inside your cuff. Take away the upper handkerchief, and
let a third person come to examine, when he will find the
ring gone out of the handkerchief, and hung upon the rod.</p>


<p class="p6">5. TO TIE A KNOT IN A HANDKERCHIEF WHICH CANNOT BE
DRAWN TIGHT.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_006.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Cast an ordinary knot on a handkerchief, and give the
end out of your right hand to
some spectator, and tell him to
pull hard and sharp when you
count three. Just as he pulls,
slip your left thumb under the
handkerchief, as drawn in the
cut, and it will be pulled out
quite straight, without any knot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
at all. You must let go the end that hangs over the left
hand, and grasp the handkerchief between the thumb and
fore finger.</p>


<p class="p6">6. THE THREE CUPS.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_007.jpg" width="200" height="94" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This is an admirable delusion, but requires very careful
management, and should be practiced repeatedly before it
is exhibited publicly. You get three tin cups, of the shape
shown in the cut. They should have two or three ridges
running round them at the mouth, in order to give a better
hold. Four balls should now be
made of cork, and carefully blackened.
One of the balls is held concealed
between the roots of the
third and fourth fingers, while the
other three are handed round for
examination, together with the cups. When they are returned,
the young conjuror begins by placing each ball
under a cup, or, if he chooses, asking one of the spectators to
do so for him. While this is being done, he slips the fourth
ball to the tips of the second and third fingers. He then lifts
up cup No. 1, replaces it on the table a few inches from its
first position, and at the same time slips the fourth ball
under it. He takes up ball No. 1, and pretends to throw it
away, but in reality he slips it into the place which the
fourth ball had occupied. He does the same with the three
cups, and then commences a sham search after the lost ball,
in which he accidentally (!) knocks over one of the cups,
and, to his pretended astonishment, finds a ball under it.
He then knocks over both the other cups, and finds in them
the two missing balls.</p>

<p>He again places the balls under the cups, taking care to
slip the fourth ball under cup No. 3. He then takes up cup
No. 1, and pretends to throw the ball into No. 3, but hides it
as before. As there are already two balls in No. 3, the spectators
imagine that he really has thrown the ball into it.
He replaces cup No. 3 over both balls, and slips among them
ball No. 1. He then takes up cup No. 2, and goes through
the same process, and on knocking over cup No. 3, all three
balls are found together under it, and while the spectators
are being astonished, ball No 2 can be quickly got rid of.</p>

<p>A rather startling termination to this trick can be managed
by taking up one of the cups, with its mouth upwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
holding the finger and thumb close to its mouth. Then by
throwing another cup into it, letting go the first and catching
the second, you appear to have thrown the second cup
through the first.</p>


<p class="p6">7. TO TIE A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND YOUR LEG, AND GET IT OFF
WITHOUT UNTYING THE KNOT.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_008a.jpg" width="150" height="113" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Hold the handkerchief by both ends, lay the center of the
handkerchief on your knee, and pass the two ends below,
appearing to cross them, but in reality hitching them within
each other, as represented in the engraving,
which shows the manner in
which this is managed. Draw this loop
tight, and bring back the ends to the
same side on which they were originally,
and tie them above. If the loop
is properly made, it will stand a good
pull. Then, after showing the spectators
how firmly it is tied, put your hand under the knot, and
by giving it a sharp pull, it will come off.</p>

<p>The engraving represents the manner in which the loop is
made, but it must be made considerably smaller than it is
shown, or it will be seen. In fact, it ought not to be a loop
at all, as it should be almost concealed under the fold of the
handkerchief. Do not show this in public until you can tie
it with rapidity and precision.</p>

<p>Take a piece of string, and tie the two ends
together with a weaver's knot, as that holds
the best, and arrange it over the fingers, as represented
in the engraving. Having done so,
let the long loop hang loose, lift both loops off
the thumb, draw them forward until the string
is quite tight, and then put them behind the
hand, by passing them between the second and
third fingers. Then pull the part of the string
that lies across the roots of the fingers, and
the whole affair will come off.</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>Take the same piece of string as in the last trick, hold
your left hand with the palm uppermost, and hang the string
over the palm. Spread all the fingers, and with the right
hand bring forward the loops that hang behind, by passing
it over the second and third fingers. Loose the loop,
take hold of the part of the string that crosses the hand,
and pull it forwards. When tight, pass it to the back of
the hand, the reversal of the movement that
brought it forwards. Loose the loop, insert
the fore-finger and little finger of the right
hand under the string that encircles the left
fore-finger and little finger, and pass the two
loops to the back of the hand, as shown in the
cut, Fig. 1. Tuck both loops under the cross-strings
at the back, and your preliminaries are
completed. Then begin your story: "There
was once upon a time, an old man, who stole
a pound of candles. Here they are." You then hold your
left hand as at the commencement, hook the right fore-finger
under the cross-piece at the back, and
draw it downward until it is long enough to
be passed over the second and third fingers to
the front. Pass it over, and draw it slowly
upwards, when the similitude of a pound of
candles hanging by their strings will be seen.
(See Fig. 2.) "The old man being tired hung
up his candles," you then hang the long loop
over your thumb, "and sat down in his high-backed
chair, which you see here." You then
hitch the right fore finger and middle finger
under the two loops that will be found hanging
behind the left hand, bring them to the
front, raise them perpendicularly, and the
chair will be seen as in Fig. 3. The thumb
must be raised perpendicularly, and brought
as much as possible into the center of the hand,
or the chair will be all aside.</p>

<p>"When the old man was rested, it began to
become dark, and he took a pair of scissors to
cut down a candle for himself. Here are the
scissors." While you are saying this, you
slip the loop off the thumb, and you get Fig. 4.
Move the blades and handles of the scissors,
as if cutting something with them. "Just as
he had lighted it, in came a policeman, and produced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
staff, with the Queen's crown at the top." Now let go the
little finger of the left hand and the loop will run up the
string towards the right hand, producing Fig. 5. "The old
man in vain tried to resist, for the policeman called a comrade
to his assistance, and they tied a cord round the old
man's arms in a tight knot, like this"&mdash;slip the right middle
finger out of its loop, and you will obtain Fig. 6&mdash;"and
carried him off to prison."</p>

<p>Take a piece of thick pliant string by each end, and with
a quick jerk of the right hand cast a loop on it as in Fig. 1.
The jerk must be given upwards and towards the left hand,
and its impetus will cause the loop to run up the string
until it falls over the left wrist, as in Fig. 2. The moment
that the forward jerk is given the right hand should be
drawn back, so that the loop is drawn tight directly it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
settled on the wrist. Both ends should be let fall when the
knot is firm. This is a very nice little sleight of hand trick
to practice in the intervals between more showy ones, and,
although rather difficult to learn, is soon acquired.</p>

</div>

<p>Let two persons, <span class="smcapa">A</span> and <span class="smcapa">B</span>, have their hands tied together
with string, so that the strings cross, as represented in the
engraving. The object is, to free themselves from each
other without untying the knot. It is executed in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Let <span class="smcapa">B</span> gather up the string that joins his hands, pass the
loop under the string that binds either of <span class="smcapa">A</span>'s wrists, slip it
over <span class="smcapa">A</span>'s hand, and both will be free. By a reversal of the
same process, the string may be replaced.</p>


<p class="p6">12. TO PULL A STRING THROUGH YOUR BUTTON-HOLE.</p>

<p>Take a piece of string about two feet in length, and tie
the ends together. Pass it through a button-hole of your
coat; hitch one thumb at each end,
hook the little fingers into the upper
strings of the opposite hand. Then
draw the hands well outward, and
the string will look very complicated,
as in the engraving.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/i_011b.jpg" width="210" height="212" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To get out the string, loose the
hold of the right thumb and left
little finger, and separate the hands
smartly, when the string will appear
to have been pulled out <em>through</em>
the substance of your coat.</p>

<p>It is an improvement of the trick, if, immediately on
loosing the hold of the right thumb, you change the string
from the right little finger on to the thumb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">13. THE CUT STRING RESTORED.</p>

<p>Tie together the ends of a piece of string, pass one hand
through each end, twist it once round, and put both ends into
the left hand. Draw the right hand rapidly along the double
strings until you come to the place where the strings have
crossed each other, as seen in the engraving. Conceal the
junction with the thumb and finger of the right hand; hold
the strings in a similar manner with the left hand, and tell
some one to cut the string between them. You show that
the string has been divided into two pieces, and say that
you will join them with your teeth. Put all four ends into
your mouth, and remove with your tongue the little loop that
has been cut off. When you take the string out of your
mouth, the spectators will not notice the absence of so small
a portion of its length, and will fancy that you really have
joined them.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_012b.jpg" width="125" height="220" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Take a silk handkerchief, and lay it on a table. Take each
of the corners, and lay them across each other in the middle
of the handkerchief, which will then be
square, as in the cut, Fig. 1. Do the same
with the new corners, and go on until the
handkerchief is reduced to the size of your
hand. Then with your left finger and thumb
take hold of the center, taking care to grasp
all the four corners that lie there, and with
the right finger and thumb take hold of the
outer layer of silk, and pull it towards you
as far as it will come. Then turn it a little
on your left hand, and repeat the operation
until it is all screwed up into a tight ball,
as is represented in the engraving, Fig. 2.
No ends will be then perceptible, and a person
who is unacquainted with the mode will never be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to untie it. Of course you must prepare it previously.
When the person to whom you give it has failed to untie
it, you take the ball in your hand, and holding it behind your
back, you reverse the method by which it was tied, and
when it is loose a good shake will release it.</p>


<p class="p6">15. THE KNOT LOOSENED.</p>

<p>This is a very amusing deception. You ask any one for
a handkerchief, and tie the ends firmly together in a double
knot, allowing him to feel it, or
pull the ends as tight as he pleases.
You then throw the center of the
handkerchief over the knot, ask
the person to hold it tight between
his finger and thumb. You ask
him if the knot is still there, to
which he will answer in the affirmative. You then take
hold of any part of the handkerchief, and direct the holder
to drop the handkerchief at the word "three." You count,
"one, two, three," at which word he looses his hold of the
handkerchief, and there is no vestige left of the knot.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="175" height="95" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The method of managing this trick is as follows: Take
the handkerchief and tie the ends in a simple knot, keeping
<em>one end tight</em>, and the other end loose. We will call the tight
end <span class="smcapa">A</span>, and the loose one <span class="smcapa">B</span>. Keep <span class="smcapa">A</span> <em>always</em> in the right hand,
and on the stretch horizontally, and the handkerchief will
look as in the cut. Do this when you tie it the second time,
and draw <span class="smcapa">B</span> tight, which will then form a double tie round
<span class="smcapa">A</span>, but will not hold it firm. When you throw the handkerchief
over the knot, you draw out <span class="smcapa">A</span> with the finger and
thumb of the left hand, and the knot will apparently remain
firm, although in reality it is nothing but a double twist of
silk, which of course falls loose when the handkerchief is
dropped.</p>


<p class="p6">16. TO PUT NUTS INTO YOUR EAR.</p>

<p>Take three nuts in the left hand, show them, and take
out one of them between your right finger and thumb, and
another between the first and third finger. This latter is
not seen by the company. You then put one of them in your
mouth and retain it there, unknown to the spectators, while
you exhibit the second as the one that you put into your
mouth. This second one you carry to your ear, as if you
meant to insert it there, and on replacing it in your left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
hand, only two nuts will be left instead of three, the third of
which appears to have gone into your ear.</p>


<p class="p6">17. TO CRACK WALNUTS IN YOUR ELBOW.</p>

<p>Conceal a very strong walnut in your right hand, and
take two other walnuts out of the dish. Place one of them
on the joint of your arm, and say that you are going to
break it by the power of your muscles. You will now have
one walnut in your arm and two in your right hand. Close
your left arm, and strike it an apparently violent blow with
the right hand, at the same time clenching the right hand
violently, which will smash the second walnut in it, and
the spectators hearing the crash will be sure to fancy that it
is caused by the demolition of the walnut in your arm.
Then open your arm very gently (for fear of dropping any
of the fragments, you must say), and, when pretending to
take out the walnut which you had placed there, you substitute
for it the broken one from your right hand.</p>


<p class="p6">18. TO TAKE FEATHERS OUT OF AN EMPTY HANDKERCHIEF.</p>

<p>Procure at the military clothier's four or five large plumes,
such as are worn by officers. Take off your coat, and lay
the plumes along your arms, the stem being toward your
hand. Now put on your coat again, and the feathers will lie
quite smoothly and unsuspected. Borrow a handkerchief
from one of the spectators, and wave it about to show that
it is empty. Throw it over your left hand, and with the
right draw out one of the plumes from up the coat-sleeve,
at the same time giving it a flourish in the air, which will
loosen all the fibers of the feather, and make it appear much
too large to have been concealed about the person. Wave
the handkerchief again, and repeat the operation until all
the plumes are gone. You can carry enough plumes under
the sleeve to cover a table with, and if you prepare a board
or an ornamental vase full of holes, you can place the
plumes upright as you take them out.</p>


<p class="p6">19. THE KNOTTED HANDKERCHIEF.</p>

<p>This feat consists in tying a number of hard knots in a
pocket-handkerchief borrowed from one of the company,
then letting any person hold the knots, and by the operator
merely shaking the handkerchief, all the knots become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
unloosened, and the handkerchief is restored to its original
state.</p>

<p>To perform this excellent trick, get as soft a handkerchief
as possible, and taking the opposite ends, one in each
hand, throw the right hand over the left, and draw it through,
as if you were going to tie a knot in the usual way. Again
throw the right-hand end over the left, and give the left-hand
end to some person to pull, you at the same time pulling
the right-hand end with your right hand, while your
left hand holds the handkerchief just behind the knot.
Press the thumb of your left hand against the knot to prevent
its slipping, always taking care to let the person to
whom you gave one end pull first: so that, in fact, he is
only pulling against your <em>left hand</em>.</p>

<p>You now tie another knot exactly in the same way as the
first, taking care always to throw the right-hand end over
the left. As you go on tying the knots, you will find the
right-hand end of the handkerchief decreasing considerably
in length, while the left-hand one remains nearly as long
as at first; because, in fact, you are merely tying the right-hand
end <em>round the left</em>. To prevent this from being noticed,
you should stoop down a little after each knot, and pretend
to pull the knots tighter; while, at the same time, you
press the thumb of the right hand against the knot, and
with the fingers and palm of the same hand, draw the handkerchief,
so as to make the left-hand end shorter, keeping it
at each knot as nearly the length of the right-hand end as
possible.</p>

<p>When you have tied as many knots as the handkerchief
will admit of, hand them round for the company to feel that
they are firm knots; then hold the handkerchief in your
right hand, just below the knots, and with the left hand
turn the loose part of the center of the handkerchief over
them, desiring some person to hold them. Before they take
the handkerchief in hand, you draw out the right-hand end
of the handkerchief, which you have in the right hand, and
which you may easily do, and the knots being still held together
by the loose part of the handkerchief, the person
who holds the handkerchief will declare he feels them:
you then take hold of one of the ends of the handkerchief
which hangs down, and desire him to repeat after you,
one, two, three; then tell him to let go, when, by giving
the handkerchief a smart shake, the whole of the knots will become
unloosed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Should you, by accident, whilst tying the knots, give the
wrong end to be pulled, a hard knot will be the consequence,
and you will know when this has happened the
instant you try to draw the left-hand end of the handkerchief
shorter. You must, therefore, turn this mistake to
the best advantage, by asking any one of the company to
see how long it will take him to untie one knot, you counting
the seconds. When he has untied the knot, your other
knots will remain right as they were before. Having finished
tying the knots, let the same person hold them, and
tell him that, as he took two minutes to untie one knot, he
ought to allow you fourteen minutes to untie the seven;
but as you do not wish to take any advantage, you will be
satisfied with fourteen seconds.</p>

<p>You may excite some laughter during the performance of
this trick, by desiring those who pull the knots along with
you, to pull as hard as they please, and not to be afraid, as
the handkerchief is not yours; you may likewise go to the
owner of the handkerchief, and desire him to assist you in
pulling a knot, saying, that if the handkerchief is to be torn,
it is only right that he should have a share of it; you may
likewise say that he does not pull very hard, which will
cause a laugh against him.</p>


<p class="p6">20. HOUDIN'S NUT TRICK.</p>

<p>To perform a clever trick with dexterity before a "small
party" is at once to become the hero of the evening. If you
cannot sing, you must solve conundrums, or dance a horn-pipe;
if neither of these be "your forte," a good trick or
two will give equal pleasure to the "bright blue eyes" peering
at you. The nut trick is exhibited thus: The professor
hands the audience a dessert plate and a cambric handkerchief
for examination; these being returned, he places the
plate upon a table near to him; the handkerchief is then
spread out quite flat over the plate. At command, sugared
almonds, nuts, and comfits pour into the dessert plate the
instant the kerchief is lifted up, producing an effect that
would have astonished the magi of old. The way in which
it is done is this: Make a calico bag large enough to hold
the nuts and sweetmeats you intend to distribute, exactly
to the pattern of a nightcap, or the letter A: a small selvage
is turned up at the bottom of the bag; procure two pieces
of watch spring, and bend them quite flat, each spring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
be exactly half the diameter of the bag. These are put into
the selvage, and sewn up firm. When the bag is opened, it
will close itself in consequence of the springs. A long pin
is passed through the top of the bag and bent round hook-shape.
If the bag be now filled with nuts, &amp;c., it may be
suspended by the hook, without any danger of the nuts or
anything else falling out; because, although the mouth of
the bag is downwards, the springs keep it shut. When this
trick is to be shown, the prepared bag is hung on the side
of the table that is away from the audience. The plate is
also placed on that side; and when the handkerchief is laid
over the plate a portion is left to fall over the side of the
table. Now the kerchief is picked up with the <em>right</em> hand
in the center (just as a lady does when she wishes to exhibit
the lace edge), and with it the bag of nuts; the folds of the
cambric hide the bag. The left hand is now used to draw
over the handkerchief and to press the bag; this causes
the springs to open, and out fall the "good things" upon
the plate. This causes sufficient diversion for the merest
tyro of a conjuror to drop the bag behind the table unseen,
while he advances to the audience, politely inquiring, "Will
you take a few nuts or sweetmeats?"</p>


<p class="p6">21. CONJURING A RING.</p>

<p>Several very marvelous tricks can be shown with an ordinary
finger ring, such as passing it through the table,
through a basin, an ale-glass or a plate, then into a box or
nest of boxes, and other feats of legerdemain of a similar
kind. These tricks are so good that they are always shown
by the professors of magic at evening parties, but are never
explained; however, we will attempt it. Procure a soft
clean silk handkerchief and a sham gold ring; now a needleful
of black silk, double; sew the silk to the middle of the
handkerchief, and let the ring hang from it, suspended by
the end of the silk, say at about three or four inches from
the kerchief. When the handkerchief is held up by two
corners, the suspended ring must always hang on the side
facing the magician; the handkerchief can then be shaken,
folded, and crumpled up in the hands, so as to make it appear
"all fair." Now, to pass a ring through a drinking-glass
and plate, and through the table on which it is placed.
"If any lady or gentleman will kindly lend me a ring, I
shall be happy to exhibit the electric and magnetic action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of metallic substances on <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'diaphonous'">diaphanous</ins> bodies and ceramic
manufactures, by showing their imperviousness, and the porosity
of ligneous products of the Honduras." "Hem!"
says Aunt Caroline, "what an extraordinary youth!" Do
not, however, allow yourself to be carried away by any
flattery of this kind, but determine to do the trick well, and
<em>deserve</em> praise. Take the borrowed ring in the <span class="smcapa">LEFT</span> hand,
and keep it there; pretend to pass it to the right hand, and
say, "I will place it in the handkerchief. Who will kindly
hold it for me while I put the glass on the plate in the center
of the table?" While you thus freely ask who will
hold the kerchief, you will secure the most bashful lady or
gentleman in the company to hold the (your) ring in the
handkerchief. "You will perceive, ladies and gentlemen,
that the glass and the plate are now quite empty. I shall
now place the glass in the plate on to the center of the
table, and request the lady (or gent) to place the ring and
the handkerchief over the glass. I particularly draw your
attention to the fact that you will <em>hear</em> the ring fall into the
glass when I request it to be released. You will then be
certain that it is in the glass; but at my command it shall
pass into this box (show the box round), which I shall place
under the table. Now, miss (or sir) be good enough to let
the ring fall into the glass. Silence! Ting! You heard
it fall?" "Yes," all must reply, except the deaf. Presto!
It is now in the box. You lift the handkerchief, smooth
down your brow with it, and put it into your pocket. The
audience are now left to themselves. They rush to the
plate and glass, it is not there; now the box, behold! it is
as sound as ever: how it got there Aunt Carry could never
tell, but you could, for you put it there out of your left hand
when you placed the box under the table.</p>

is to remove the small coin from beneath the
larger one, without touching either of the coins,
or touching or upsetting the glass. To do this
capital trick you must blow with considerable
force down one side of the glass upon the edge
of the quarter. The dime will be expelled by
the force of the air, and will fall either upon
the upper surface of the quarter or upon the
table. A little practice will render the performance
of this feat very easy.</p>


<p class="p6">25. ADVANTAGEOUS WAGER.</p>

<p>Request a lady to lend you a watch. Examine it, and
give a guess as to its value; then offer to lay the owner
a wager, considerably below the real value of the watch,
that she will not answer to three questions which you will
put to her consecutively, "My watch." Show her the
watch, and say, "What is this which I hold in my hand?"
she, of course, will not fail to reply, "My watch." Next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
present to her notice some other object, repeating the same
question. If she name the object you present, she loses
the wager; but if she be on her guard, and remembering
her stake, she says, "My watch," she must, of course, win;
and you, therefore, to divert her attention, should observe
to her, "You are certain to win the stake, but supposing I
lose, what will you give me?" and if, confident of success,
she replies for the third time, "My watch," then take it and
leave her the wager agreed on.</p>


<p class="p6">26. THE DOUBLE MEANING.</p>

<p>Place a glass of any liquor upon the table, put a hat over
it, and say, "I will engage to drink the liquor under that
hat, and yet I'll not touch the hat." You then get under
the table, and after giving three knocks, you make a noise
with your mouth as if you were swallowing the liquor.
Then getting from under the table, you say, "Now, gentlemen,
be pleased to look." Some one, eager to see if you
drank the liquor, will raise up the hat, when you instantly
take the glass, and drink the contents, saying, "Gentlemen,
I have fulfilled my promise. You are all witnesses that <em>I</em>
did not touch the hat."</p>


<p class="p6">27. THE THREE SPOONS.</p>

<p>This is a most capital trick, but it requires a confederate's
aid. Place three silver spoons crosswise on a table,
request any person to touch one, and assure him you will
find out the one he touches by a single inspection; although
you will leave the room while he does so, and even if he
touches it so gently as not to disarrange the order in which
they are once put in the slightest degree. You retire; and
when he gives you notice to enter, walk up to the table
and inspect the spoons, as if trying to ascertain whether
there are any finger-marks upon them, and then decide.
Your confederate, of course, makes some sign, previously
agreed upon, to give you notice which is the identical
spoon; the actions may be, touching a button of his jacket
for the top spoon, touching his chin for the second, and putting
his finger to his lips may signify the lowest; but the
precise actions are immaterial, so that the spoon they indicate
be understood.</p>


<p class="p6">28. THE JUGGLER'S JOKE.</p>

<p>Take a little ball in each hand, and stretch your hands as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
far apart as you possibly can, one from the other; then tell
the company that you will make both the balls come into
whichever hand they please, without bringing the hands
into contact with each other. If any of the lookers-on
challenge your ability of achieving this feat, all you have
to do is to lay one of the balls down upon a table, turn
yourself round, and take it up with your other hand.
Both the balls will thus be in one of your hands, without the
latter approaching the other, agreeably to your promise.</p>


<p class="p6">29. TO CAUSE WINE AND WATER TO CHANGE PLACES.</p>

<p>Fill a small narrow-necked bulb with port wine, or with
water and colored spirit of wine, and put the bulb into a
tall, narrow glass jar, which is then to be filled up with cold
water: immediately, the colored fluid will issue from the
bulb, and accumulate on the surface of the water in the
jar, while colorless water will be seen accumulating at the
bottom of the bulb. By close inspection, the descending
current of the water may also be observed, and the colored
and the colorless liquids be seen to pass each other in the
narrow neck of the bulb without mixing. The whole of
the colored fluid will shortly have ascended, and the bulb
will be entirely filled with clear water.</p>


<p class="p6">30. IS IT POSSIBLE?</p>

<p>Side by side place three pieces of anything, (money is
most convenient,) then take away the middle piece without
touching it.</p>

<p>By removing the right hand piece to the side of the left,
you thus take away the center without touching it.</p>


<p class="p6">31. THE TOPER'S STRATAGEM.</p>

<p>Get a bottle full of water, with the cork driven tightly
in, and the top of it level with the neck of the bottle. You
must remove the cork from the bottle without touching the
cork with anything, and without injuring the bottle.</p>

<p>Wrap a towel round the bottom of the bottle, and strike
it evenly and repeatedly, but not too hard, against a wall,
post, or tree, and after some time the cork will be driven
out of the bottle.</p>


<p class="p6">32. THE IMPOSSIBLE OMELET.</p>

<p>Produce some butter, eggs, and other ingredients for making
an omelet, together with a frying-pan, in a room where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
there is a fire, and offer to bet a wager, that the cleverest
cook will not be able to make an omelet with them. The
wager is won by having previously caused the eggs to be
boiled very hard.</p>


<p class="p6">33. NEW PERPETUAL ROTARY MOTION.</p>

<p>By an accidental occurrence, it has recently been discovered
that a piece of rock-crystal, or quartz, cut in a
peculiar form, produces, upon an inclined plane, and without
any apparent impetus, an extraordinary rotary motion,
which maybe kept up for an indefinite period of time. The
curiosity of this philosophical toy having excited general
interest in the scientific world, Professor Leslie, in his lecture,
thus explains the phenomenon:</p>

<p>"The crystal has six sides, and being cut accurately from
the faces to a perfect convex surface, if placed upon a
wetted smooth surface, and held parallel, no motion will take
place, because the center of gravity of each face is balanced
and supported in this position of the plane surface; but if
a slight inclination is given to the plane, a rotary motion
commences, in consequence of the support being removed
from the center of gravity. The impetus once given, the
centrifugal force increases the rotary motion to such a
degree, as for an observer to be unable to distinguish the
form of the crystal.</p>

<p>"<em>To produce the effect.</em>&mdash;Place the crystal on a piece of plate
or common window glass, a china or glazed plate, or any
smooth surface, perfectly clean, as grease or a particle of
dust would impede its motion. Wet the surface, and give
the plane a slight inclination, when, if properly managed,
a rotatory motion will commence, which may be kept up for
any length of time by giving alternate inclinations to the
plane surface, according to the movements of the crystal;
to heighten the pleasing effect of which, a variety of paper
figures, harlequins, waltzers, &amp;c., may be attached. The first
trial of the experiment had better be made by giving a
slight rotatory motion to the crystal."</p>


<p class="p6">34. THE MIRACULOUS APPLE.</p>

<p>To divide an apple into several parts, without breaking
the rind. Pass a needle and thread under the rind of the
apple, which is easily done by putting the needle in again
at the same hole it came out of; and so passing on till you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
have gone round the apple. Then take both ends of the
thread in your hands and draw it out, by which means the
apple will be divided into two parts. In the same manner,
you may divide it into as many parts as you please, and yet
the rind will remain entire. Present the apple to any one
to peel, and it will immediately fall to pieces.</p>


<p class="p6">35. AN OMELET COOKED IN A HAT, OVER THE FLAME OF A CANDLE.</p>

<p>State that you are about to cook an omelet; then you
break four eggs in a hat, place the hat for a short time over
the flame of a candle, and shortly after produce an omelet,
completely cooked, and quite hot.</p>

<p>Some persons will be credulous enough to believe that by
the help of certain ingredients you have been enabled to
cook the omelet without fire; but the secret of the trick is,
that the omelet had been previously cooked and placed in
the hat, but could not be seen, because the operator, when
breaking the eggs, placed it too high for the spectators to
observe the contents. The eggs were empty ones, the contents
having been previously extracted, by being sucked
through a small aperture; but to prevent the company from
suspecting this, the operator should, as if by accident, let a
full egg fall on the table, which breaking, induces a belief
that the others are also full.</p>


<p class="p6">36. THE INFALLIBLE PROPHET.</p>

<p>In this trick one of three articles being taken by each of
three persons, you propose to tell the article each person has
taken. We will suppose the articles to be a ring, dime or
shilling, and a key. The performer must in his own mind,
term the ring <em>a</em>, the shilling or dime <em>e</em>, and key <em>i</em>: (this
being the alphabetical order of the vowels, can be easily
recollected) and he must also mentally distinguish the persons
as first, second and third. Then taking twenty-four counters
or cards, he gives one to the first person, two to the second
and three to the third; and placing the remainder of the
counters on the table, he turns his back or leaves the room,
telling the persons each to take an article, and that whoever
takes the ring is to take also as many counters as he already
has; he who takes the shilling, twice as many; and he who
takes the key, four times as many. This being done, the performer
advances, and reckons the remaining counters, and
according to their number and the underneath line, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
he must have previously acquired, he tells who has taken
each of the different articles.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="mleft1">1.</span>   <span class="mleft1">2.</span>  <span class="mleft2">3.</span> <span class="mleft2">5.</span>   <span class="mleft1">6.</span> <span class="mleft1">7.</span><br />
Salve    certa    animæ    semita    vita    quies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, if there had been a remainder of six counters, the
position of the vowels in the corresponding word <em>vita</em>, shows
that the first person took <em>i</em>, the key; and the second person
took <em>a</em>, the ring; and, consequently, the third person must
have taken the shilling. It must be observed, that in no instance
can there be a remainder of four counters; and that
the first syllable of each word represents the first person,
and the second syllable the second person. This ingenious
feat is founded on the permutation of the three articles, or
their representative vowels, which can only be placed in six
different positions, and the corresponding numerical
arrangement of the counters, thus:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="numerical arrangement of the counters">
<tr>
 <td class="tdl">1.</td>
 <td class="tdl"><em>a</em> <em>e</em> <em>i</em></td>
 <td class="tdl">salve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdl">2.</td>
 <td class="tdl"><em>e</em> <em>a</em> <em>i</em></td>
 <td class="tdl">certa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdl">3.</td>
 <td class="tdl"><em>a</em> <em>i</em> <em>e</em></td>
 <td class="tdl">animæ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdl">5.</td>
 <td class="tdl"><em>e</em> <em>i</em> <em>a</em></td>
 <td class="tdl">semita.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdl">6.</td>
 <td class="tdl"><em>i</em> <em>a</em> <em>e</em></td>
 <td class="tdl">vita.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdl">7.</td>
 <td class="tdl"><em>i</em> <em>e</em> <em>a</em></td>
 <td class="tdl">quies.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The three vowels, in their different positions, are made
easy of recollection, by being united with consonants and
formed in their regular succession into the above Latin line,
or into this similarly constructed French one:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="mleft1">1.</span>  <span class="mleft2">2.</span>  <span class="mleft1">3.</span> <span class="mleft2">5.</span>  <span class="mleft2">6.</span>  <span class="mleft2">7.</span><br />
Par fer   Cesar   jadis   devint   si grand   prince.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/i_025b.jpg" width="110" height="172" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This feat is really an excellent one, and has astonished
crowds of spectators in different parts of the United States.
It was one of the favorites of a late professor, by whom it
was promulgated. Before you perform it in public, you
must practice it until you are quite perfect, in private, for
it would be a pity to spoil its effect by making a blunder in
it. Begin by stating that you are about performing what
you have no doubt will be regarded as a
very extraordinary maneuver, and you
will leave the company to decide upon
what principle of natural philosophy it is
accomplished. The mode of performance
is as follows: Lay the piece of wood
across the palm of your left hand, which
keep wide open, with the thumb and all
the fingers far apart, lest you be suspected
of supporting the wood with them. Next,
take your left wrist in your right hand, and grasp it tightly,
for the purpose, as you state, of giving the hand more
steadiness. Now, suddenly turn the back of your left hand
uppermost, and as your wrist moves in your right hand,
stretch out the forefinger of your right hand, and as soon as
the wood comes undermost, support it with such forefinger.
You may now shake the hand, and, after a moment or two,
suffer the wood to drop. It is two to one but the spectators
will suppose it to be produced by the action of the air, and
try to do it themselves; but, of course, they must, unless
you have performed the feat so awkwardly
as to be discovered, fail in its performance.
If you have no objection to reveal the
secret, you can do it again, and while they
are gravely philosophizing upon it, suddenly
lift up your hand (<em>vide</em> Cut), and
expose the trick. This will, doubtless,
create much amusement. Observe that, in
doing this feat, you must keep your fingers
so low that no one can see the palm of
your left hand; and move your finger so
carefully, that its action may not be detected;
and if it be not, you may rest satisfied
that its absence from round the wrist of the left hand
will not be discovered, some of the fingers being naturally
supposed to be under the coat; so that, if the spectators
only see two or even one, they will imagine the others are
beneath the cuff. When you have turned your hand over, do
not keep the stick too long upheld, lest the spectators should
take hold of your hands, and discover the trick; before their
surprise is over, remove your forefinger, and suffer the stick
to fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">38. THE DISAPPEARING DIME.</p>

<p>Provide yourself with a piece of India rubber cord about
twelve inches long, and a dime with a hole on the edge;
attach the dime to the cord with a piece of white sewing
silk, and after having done this, sew the cord to your coat
sleeve lining, but be very careful and ascertain that the end
upon which the dime is attached does not extend lower than
within two inches of the extreme end of the sleeve when the
coat is on. It is better to have the dime in the left arm
sleeve. Having done this, bring down the dime with the
right hand, and place it between the thumb and index finger
of the left hand, and, showing it to the company, tell them
that you will give the coin to any one present who will not
let it slip away. You must then select one of the audience
to whom you proffer the dime, and just as he is about to receive
it you must let it slip from between your fingers, and
the contraction of the elastic cord will make the coin disappear
up your sleeve, much to the astonishment of the person
who thinks he is about to receive it. This feat can be varied
by pretending to wrap the coin in a piece of paper, or
a handkerchief. Great care should be taken not to let any
part of the cord be seen, as this would, of course, discover
the trick. This is one of the most surprising feats of legerdemain,
and its chief beauty consists in its extreme simplicity.
The writer has frequently astonished a whole room
full of company by the performance of this trick.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="p6">TRICKS REQUIRING SPECIAL APPARATUS.</p>

<p>I admit no tricks that are wholly managed by the apparatus,
as I think they are unworthy of notice. Therefore,
every trick mentioned in the following pages must be carefully
practiced in private before it is produced in public.
The apparatus, of course, cannot be inspected by the
audience, and for that reason it is better to mix them with
those tricks that have been already mentioned, in order that
suspicious persons may be quieted by an occasional permission
to inspect the objects used in the performances.</p>

<p>The young conjuror should always vary the mode of performance
in the non-essentials, and should study combinations
of one trick with another, by which means he will
produce more astonishing results than if he restricted himself
to the methods mentioned in this work. He should also invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
make a little speech, acknowledging that he is only
deceiving the eye and not the mind, and should therefore
request the company not to ask any questions, or to demand
inspection of any of his apparatus.</p>


<p class="p6">39. THE DIE TRICK.</p>

<p>Get a wooden die about two inches and a half square (1),
and a hollow tin die exactly the size of the wooden one, but
without one of the sides (2). Then paint them both exactly
alike, as in the engraving. It will be better to let an <em>accidental</em>
flaw appear on the same side of each. Then get a tin
cover (4) that exactly fits the dice. Now for the trick itself.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 240px;">
<img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="240" height="205" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Borrow two hats, and while you turn your back upon the
audience as you go to your table, slip into one of them the
false die. Place both hats on the table, and send round the
real die and cover for inspection.
When they are returned, say, "Now,
ladies and gentlemen, it is my intention
to place these hats one
above another, thus." You then
place the two hats as in No. 3, the
hollow die being in the bottom hat.
"I shall then cover the die thus,"
which you do, "and after I have
knocked on the cover, I shall take
it off, and you will find that the die is not under the cover,
as it is now," taking it off, "but inside the hat, like this."
You then put the real die into the hat. "You do not believe
me, ladies and gentlemen, but I will soon convince you."
You then take out the false die, and replacing the upper hat,
put the die on the upper hat (of course, with the open side
downward,) and place the cover over it. Pick up your conjuring
wand, give it a few flourishes, and bring it down on
the cover. Grasp the cover tightly near the bottom, when
both cover and false die will come up together; put the end
of your wand into them, and give them a good rattle. Then
knock off the upper hat with a blow of the wand, and push
the lower one off the table, so that the die tumbles out of it.
Always use plenty of gesture about your tricks.</p>


<p class="p6">40. THE PENETRATIVE CENTS.</p>

<p>Get a brazier to cut out all the interior of five cents, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
leaving the rims. He must then bore out nearly all the interior
of a sixth cent, merely leaving a shell of copper at
the top. A long rivet must then be
let into the rim, as shown in Fig. 1,
No. 2, and a hole must be drilled in
each of the five rings, as in No. 3.
The rivet is to be passed through the
holes in the rings, and fastened below,
so that all the rings can play easily
upon it. Fig. 1, No. 1, is a section of
the entire apparatus, the dotted lines
representing the rivet. They can then
be placed as shown in Fig. 2, No. 1,
and no one will imagine that they are
only shams, as you can rattle them or
move them about upon each other. A leathern cover, Fig.
2, No. 2, is then made, which passes easily over the heap
of cents, but being pliable, is capable of picking up the
hollow cents with it, when it is held firmly. To the under
surface of the table you fasten a little shelf, Fig. 2, No. 3,
which moves on a hinge, and is let fall by placing the foot
on the pedal, Fig. 2, No. 4, which draws the catch.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="150" height="191" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To perform the trick, place six real cents on the little shelf,
and have the sham cents on the table. Take them up and
rattle them, and put them down as in Fig. 2, No. 1. Keep
a sixpence in the palm of your hand, pick up the sham cents,
and as you put them down, slip the sixpence under them, as
you do the ball in trick 6. Take the cover, and put it over
the sham cents, make a short speech, and knock the cover
with your wand, at the same time pressing the pedal with
your foot, which will cause all the six real cents to tumble
down with a great crash. Take up the cover and false cents
together, put the end of your wand into them and hold them
up triumphantly, showing the spectators that the six cents
have been replaced by a silver sixpence. While you are
picking up the cents, slip the sham ones out of the cover
into your left hand, and take some opportunity of letting the
empty cover roll towards the audience, one of whom you
ask to pick it up and bring it to you. This maneuver generally
disarms all suspicion, for the picker-up is sure to examine
it very closely.</p>

<p>I have only given mere outlines of this really excellent
trick, which may be varied in a hundred ways, and is capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of combination with other tricks to a large extent. For
the pedal may be substituted a lever running immediately
under the surface of the table, if the performer prefers to
have a short cloth on it. There should be always two cloths
on the table; the lower one thick and soft, to prevent jingling
of objects, and the upper one white, as it displays
everything better than a colored one. The ingenuity of
the young conjuror will easily find methods of varying this
trick. <em>See Trick</em> 67, <em>page</em> 48.</p>


<p class="p6">41. THE DOLL TRICK.</p>

<p>Get a comical looking doll, and cut off his head diagonally,
taking care to do it very neatly. Drive a peg into the neck,
and bore a hole in the body, into which the peg fits, as in the
cut. Paint his body and head carefully,
and if you put a gold chain or
two round his neck, it will conceal the
line of junction. Make also a coat of
silk, and sew a pocket inside the edge
of the skirt.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="210" height="239" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Take up the doll, and say, "Now,
ladies and gentlemen, here is a very
learned man. Observe the development
of his forehead, the sagacity of
his nose, the eloquence of his lips, the
dignity of his spectacles, and the philosophy of his pigtail.
He is professor of astronomy at Timbuctoo, and here is his
gown of office. See how handsome he looks in it. He is
going to Amsterdam to see the eclipse of the last new comet.
He has the honor to wish you all farewell before starting on
his journey. Now, professor, we are waiting to see you go.
Oh! you want funds, do you? I beg your pardon; <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'here it'">here is</ins>
a quarter for you." So saying, you take your right hand
from under the gown, taking with it the body, and put the
body into your pocket, while you jingle some silver. The
head is now supported by your left hand. Pretend to give
him some money, and then say, "What! you won't go unless
you have more! Get along!" Hit the head a hard rap
with your right hand, which drives it into the pocket, which
you hold open for it with your left thumb and little finger.
"O dear! the doctor is dead, and cannot be found." Saying
this, you grasp the gown by the place where the head
is, and shake it about to show that it is empty. If you like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
you can make another oration and hold a dialogue, making
the doctor resuscitate himself, which is of course done by
taking the head out of the pocket with the left hand, and
working it about by the peg.</p>


<p class="p6">42. THE FLYING COINS.</p>

<p>Take two eagles, or rather brass imitations, and grind
them down until they are reduced to half their thickness.
Do the same with two quarter dollars, and fasten
them accurately together, so that you will have two coins,
each having one silver face, and one brass face. Take one
of them in each hand, showing the silver side of one and the
brass side of another, and offer to change them without moving
your arms. Shut your hands and the coins will turn
over. Then, on opening them again, they will appear to
have changed from one hand into the other.</p>


<p class="p6">43. THE VANISHED HALF-DIME.</p>

<p>Put a little wax on the nail of the middle finger of the
right hand, and take a half-dime into the palm of the same
hand. Close the hand, pressing the wax on the coin. Then
rapidly open it, and the silver piece will adhere to the wax,
and be quite concealed behind the finger when you hold
your hand up.</p>


<p class="p6">44. THE RESTORED DOCUMENT.</p>

<p>Make a memorandum book, and line the cover with paper
which has been previously rubbed with a mixture of lamp-black
and oil. The paper must be loosely affixed, so that it
can be raised up, and a leaf from the memorandum book
placed under it. You must also make a flat box, having a
double opening.</p>

<p>You now take a leaf out of the memorandum book, and
ask some one to write a sentence, at the same time offering
him the book to write upon. The pencil with which you
furnish him is very hard, and he is forced to press upon the
paper in order to mark. In so doing, the black is transferred
by the pressure of the pencil from the blackened paper to
the white leaf that has been placed under it, and of course
makes an exact copy of the writing. You then give the man
his document, put the memorandum book in your pocket,
and go out of the room to fetch your box, which you have
<em>forgotten</em>. While you are out of the room, you take out the
leaf from under the black paper, and put it into one side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the flat box, and shut down the cover that hides it. You
bring in the box, apologising for your absence, and give the
box, open at the <em>other</em> side, into the writer's hands. Tell him
to burn his writing in a candle, and to place the ashes in the
box. He does so, and closing the box, returns it to you.
You then flourish about a little with the box, wave it in the
air, bring it down with a bang on the table, strike it with
your wand, and then, opening it as at first, you produce the
duplicate leaf, which the writer acknowledges to be in his
own hand-writing. If the lamp-black should have come off
and smeared the paper, you can account for it by observing
that it is very difficult to get rid of all traces of the burning.</p>


<p class="p6">45. THE MAGIC RINGS.</p>

<p>Get a blacksmith to make a number of rings, about six or
seven inches in diameter, as in the cut. A is made with a
spring opening on one side, <span class="smcapa">B</span> is a set of two rings forged
permanently within each other, <span class="smcapa">C</span> is a set of three rings
formed in the same manner, and <span class="smcapa">D</span> <span class="smcapa">D</span> are two simple rings.
The rings should be about the thickness of a rather large
black-lead pencil.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="200" height="237" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Lay the rings on one another, and they will all appear to be
separate and distinct: <span class="smcapa">D</span> <span class="smcapa">D</span> should be the uppermost rings,
then <span class="smcapa">B</span>, then <span class="smcapa">A</span>, and then <span class="smcapa">C</span>. Hand round <span class="smcapa">D</span> for inspection
and if any more are desired, hand
round the other <span class="smcapa">D</span>. When returned,
hang them over your left arm, or grasp
them in your hand, and tell the company
that you are going to weave all
the rings together. You clash them
together, and after going through some
complicated movements, bring out <span class="smcapa">B</span>,
which the spectators will think you
have just fastened together. Hand
them round. When they are returned
mix them all up, and bring out <span class="smcapa">C</span>. Then take <span class="smcapa">A</span> in your
hand, and passing one of the outer rings of <span class="smcapa">C</span> through the
opening, you have four rings together. Then add <span class="smcapa">D</span> and
you have five. Take off <span class="smcapa">D</span> and substitute <span class="smcapa">B</span> which will give
you six. So you go on weaving them into all kinds of
fantastic shapes. You must always conceal the joint
in <span class="smcapa">A</span> with your thumb, and contrive as often as you
can to have one at least of the rings <span class="smcapa">D</span> at liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
This is a capital trick, and may be diversified to any
extent, especially if the number of rings is increased.</p>


<p class="p6">46. THE FISH AND INK TRICK.</p>

<p>This is really a first-rate delusion. You bring before
the spectators a glass vase, full of ink. You dip a ladle
into it, and pour out some of the ink upon a plate, in order
to convince the audience that the substance in the vase
is really ink. You then throw a handkerchief over the
vase and instantly withdraw it, when the vase is found to
be filled with pure water, in which a couple of gold fish
are swimming.</p>

<p>This apparent impossibility is performed as follows. To
the interior of the vessel is fitted a black silk lining, which
adheres closely to the sides when pressed by the water,
and which is withdrawn inside the handkerchief during the
performance of the trick. The ladle has a hollow handle
with an opening into the bowl. In the handle is a spoonful
or so of ink, which runs into the bowl when it is held
downward, during the act of dipping it into the vase.</p>


<p class="p6">47. THE CANNON BALLS.</p>

<p>The performer of this trick borrows a number of hats,
and places them on the table. He then returns each
person his hat, and on turning it over, a thirty-two pounder
cannon ball rolls out.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="220" height="192" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The method of performing this delusion is as follows.
Get a turner to make a number of wooden balls, each the
size of a thirty-two pounder cannon ball, and let a hole
be bored in each which will admit the middle finger. The
balls are arranged hole upwards on a shelf on your table
on the side opposite to your audience,
so that the balls are nearly
level with the top of the table. When
you take a hat off the table, you slip
your fore or middle finger into the
ball just as you would into a thimble,
and by bending the finger, bring the
ball into the hat.</p>

<p>Any object may be brought into a
hat in this manner, a great cabbage, for instance, having
a hole cut in the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'stall'">stalk</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">48. THE DIME IN THE BALL OF COTTON.</p>

<p>Get a tinman to make a flat tin tube, which will just
allow a dime to pass through it. Wind a quantity of
worsted round it, so as to make it into a ball.</p>

<p>These preliminaries having been accomplished, perform
any trick that will get a dime out of sight, such as number
1 or 2. Then tell the spectators that you will bring the
marked dime into the middle of a ball of worsted. Take
down the ball from the place where it is lying, drop the
dime into the tube, and withdraw the tube, leaving the
dime in the ball. A good squeeze or two will hold it tight,
and obliterate every mark of the tube. Place the ball in
a tumbler, take the end of the worsted, and give it to some
one to unwind. This being done, the dime will be found
in the very center of the ball, with the end of the worsted
wrapped tightly round it.</p>


<p class="p6">49. THE EGG AND BAG TRICK.</p>

<p>Get a chintz or cloth bag made double,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and between the
two bags make six or seven pockets, each of which will
hold an egg, and have an opening into the bag. Fill the
pockets with eggs, and you are ready for the performance.</p>

<p>Hold the bag by the place where the eggs are, shake it,
turn it inside out, and show that there is nothing in it.
Then tell the spectators, that you are sure there is a hen
in the bag. Put your head near the mouth of the bag,
and make a clucking like a hen. You then say "I knew
I was right, and she has laid an egg." So saying, you
put your hand into the bag and take out one of the eggs,
taking care to pretend to grope in one of the corners
for it.</p>

<p>This is repeated until all the eggs but one are gone.
You then, after taking out the last egg, say that some
people think the eggs are not real, but you will convince
them by ocular inspection. Saying this, you break the
egg in a saucer with your right hand, and while the people
are occupied with it, you drop the bag behind your table,
or hang it on a hook out of sight, and take up another
exactly like it, into which you have put a hen. "These are
real eggs," you then say, "and if any one doubts their
reality, they cannot doubt that this is a real hen." You
then turn the bag upside down, and shake out the hen.
If any one wishes to inspect that bag, he can do so without
being much wiser for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p class="p6">50. THE DANCING EGG.</p>

<p>Send for some eggs, and take care to place among them
one which has been emptied of its contents, and to which
is fastened a long hair, at the other end of which is tied a
crooked pin. Borrow a small stick from one of the spectators,
and as you go behind your table contrive to hook the
bent pin into your coat, passing it over the stick. Then
place the egg on an inverted hat, and ask for some music,
and directly it begins to sound, a slight and imperceptible
depression or elevation of the stick will cause the egg to
twist and roll about upon it as if it had life. You must
be careful to turn gently round now and then, so as apparently
to vary the distance of the egg from the body.</p>


<p class="p6">51. BELL AND SHOT.</p>

<p>Get a wooden bell made, so thick that there is a considerable
space between the outer and inner surfaces, especially
on the upper part of the bell.
A hollow must be cut in this, and the
handle so made, that when it is at
rest, it is forced upwards by a spring,
and draws up the round piece of wood
to which the clapper chain is attached,
and closes the aperture, as shown in
the engraving.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 180px;">
<img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="180" height="237" alt="" />
</div>

<p>You have a cardboard measure,
which is of precisely the same capacity
as the cavity in the bell, and
just wide enough to hold a cent.
Into this you privately put a cent,
and then fill up the measure with shot, heaping it
a little, to compensate for the cent. You make up a
tale about a man going out shooting, and ringing the bell
of the gunmaker's shop. (You then ring your wooden bell.)
How the man bought a measure full of shot for a cent,
(you pour the shot into the bell and back again two or
three times,) but was so long haggling over three shots,
that the gunmaker took away the shot, (here you again
pour the shot into the bell, and by pressing on the handle,
allow them all to run into the hollow,) and kept the
cent for his trouble. The man went out of the shop, but
soon came in again, and rang furiously. (Here you again
ring the bell which is now apparently empty, and invert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the measure on the table. The cent not being held
by the finger and thumb, will now fall on the tablecloth.)
Then finish the story with an account of the manner in
which the man got back his cent. When you have
finished, invert the bell over the empty measure, and on
pressing the handle, the shots will refill it. Do not touch
it until you have done another trick or two, and then, when
you put the bell aside, ring it again, and remark that the
purchaser was a silly fellow ofter all, for here are his shots
in his measure.</p>


<p class="p6">52. THE BURNED HANDKERCHIEF RESTORED.</p>

<p>Get a tinman to make a double canister, such as is
shown in the cut, with an opening at each end. This
must so slide within a tin tube, that either end can be
concealed within it alternately, as seen in the engraving,
where the end <span class="smcapa">A</span> is shown, and <span class="smcapa">B</span> is concealed.
In this position it looks like an ordinary
canister. The interior is divided into two
parts. Into <span class="smcapa">B</span> put a piece of cambric made
to look like a handkerchief.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 123px;">
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="123" height="190" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Borrow a cambric handkerchief, and say,
"Now ladies and gentlemen, I shall burn
this handkerchief to ashes, place them in this
canister," (so saying you put it into <span class="smcapa">A</span>,) "and
when I have uttered a spell, it will be restored
perfectly whole. Will the owner say
what mark it has?" While the audience are looking towards
the owner, you turn the canister over, and push up
the canister until the shoulder of <span class="smcapa">B</span> is on a level with the
top of the tube. When the mark has been declared, you
open <span class="smcapa">B</span>, take out the cambric, and pretend to verify the
mark. You then put it into a candle flame, and when it
has burned entirely to ashes, put the ashes into <span class="smcapa">B</span>, shut it up,
and rapidly reverse it as you turn round to your audience,
so that <span class="smcapa">A</span> is uppermost again. Then utter any nonsense
you like, open <span class="smcapa">A</span>, and take out the handkerchief uninjured.
It rather adds to the trick if you drop a little eau de cologne
into <span class="smcapa">A</span> before commencing.</p>


<p class="p6">53. THE FIRE EATER.</p>

<p>If the young conjuror is desirous of appearing in the
character of a fire-eater, it is very easily managed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
must prepare a piece of thick string, by soaking it in a
solution of niter, and then drying it. He cuts off a piece
about an inch in length, lights one end, and wraps it up
in a piece of tow which he holds in his left hand. The
trifling smoke will be concealed by a huge bundle of loose
tow also carried in the left hand.</p>

<p>He takes a handful of tow in his right hand, puts it into
his mouth, chews it up, and appears to swallow it. He
then takes another handful, and with it the piece in which
is the string. As he puts this into his mouth, he takes out
the piece which he has already chewed. By taking breath
through the nostrils, and breathing it out through the
mouth, smoke begins to issue forth, and the whole interior
of the mouth is soon lighted up with a glow. When the
mouth is shut, and the tow pressed together, the fire goes
out, except the piece of prepared string. More tow is then
taken into the mouth, and treated in the same manner.</p>


<p class="p6">64. THE EGG-BOX.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="210" height="154" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcapa">A</span>, the egg-box; <span class="smcapa">B</span>, the upper shell; <span class="smcapa">C</span>, the inner shell,
covered over with the shell of an egg; <span class="smcapa">D</span>, the lower part
of the box. To do the trick, call for an egg, then bid all the
by-standers look at it, and see that
it is a real egg, set the box on the
table, take off the upper part, with
your fore finger and thumb, then
placing the egg in the box, say,
"You see it fairly in," and uncovering
it again, likewise say, "You
shall see me take it out, and put it
in my pocket in your sight;" open
your box again and say, "There is nothing," close your hand
about the middle of your box, and taking <span class="smcapa">B</span> by the bottom,
say, "There is the egg again," which it appears to the spectators
to be, so clapping that in again, and taking the lid of
<span class="smcapa">C</span> in your finger and thumb, say, "There it is gone again."</p>


<p class="p6">55. THE GLOBE-BOX.</p>

<p>This trick is not inferior to the best that is shown with
boxes. It is done with a box made of four pieces, and a
ball as big as may be conveniently contained therein; the
ball serves as the egg does in the egg-box, to deceive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hand and eyes of spectators. This ball, made of wood or
ivory, is thrown out of the box upon the table, for every
one to see that it is substantial; then put the ball into the
box, which close up with all the pieces one within another;
remove the upper shell with your fore finger and thumb,
and there will appear another of a different color, red, blue,
yellow, or any other color you may fancy; this will seem
to be another ball, though, in fact, it is no more than a shell
of wood, ingeniously turned and fitted to the box, as you
may perceive by the cuts. <span class="smcapa">L</span> is the outer shell of the globe,
taken off the figure <span class="smcapa">M</span>, the top of which represents the ball;
<span class="smcapa">N</span> is an inner shell; <span class="smcapa">O</span>, the cover of the same; <span class="smcapa">P</span> another
inner shell; <span class="smcapa">Q</span>, the cover of the same; <span class="smcapa">R</span>, a third shell; <span class="smcapa">S</span>,
that which covers it. These globes may be made with more
or less varieties, according to the desire of the practitioner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="500" height="278" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="p6">56. THE COFFEE AND HANDKERCHIEF TRICKS.</p>

<p>One of the greatest means of wonder-working is that of
<em>ingenious contrivance</em>. We will illustrate this by two popular
feats. A number of handkerchiefs taken from the audience
by more than one popular performer, were placed in a small
washing tub, into which water was poured, and they were
washed for a few minutes. They were then placed in a vessel
like the figure (*) on the next page, and immediately
afterwards the performer said to the persons in front: "I
will give you these;" and taking off the top, when he was
expected to throw out the wet handkerchiefs, all that fell
was a number of flowers. He now brought out a box, which
he opened, and showed it to be empty; then shutting it,
and uttering a few cabalistic words, he opened it again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and there were the handkerchiefs, all dry, folded, and
scented, which he distributed to their respective claimants.</p>

<p>Another experiment of a popular performer was called
"coffee for the million." Producing a vessel like the diagram
<span class="smcapa">A</span>, the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'performed'">performer</ins> filled it with unground coffee, and
placing it under a cover <span class="smcapa">B</span>, he said, "There, when you have
done that, let it simmer for three quarters of an hour; but,
perhaps, you will not like to wait so long; here then it is;"
and on removing the cover, the vessel appeared full of hot
liquid coffee. In another vessel of the same kind he obtained
lump-sugar from rape-seed; and in a third, warm
milk from horse-beans; and pouring out the coffee into
cups, sent them round to regale his auditory, amidst their
loud and approving shouts at so great a transformation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="495" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="105" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These feats are the result of considerable ingenuity. It
is probable that the devices employed would not readily
occur to spectators in general, while they would utterly
escape those whose object is merely amusement, and who,
if they thought at all, would be likely to describe the result
as supernatural. We proceed, then, to the unraveling
of the mystery. Let it be observed, in reference to the
first experiment, that a number of handkerchiefs are
collected in the early part of the evening for various
illusions, and that many of them appear for a time
on the performer's table. Provided with a collection of
these articles, from the handsome silk handkerchief to one
trimmed with lace, used by a fashionable lady, he could
easily substitute his own of the same kind for those of his
auditory, as the curtain falls, according to the arrangements
of the evening, between the collection of the handkerchiefs
and the subsequent processes. His own handkerchiefs, therefore,
are washed and placed in the
vase already described; and the so-called
change into flowers is nothing
more than the retention of the handkerchiefs
in the lower part of the apparatus,
which the figure illustrates,
while the upper part holds the flowers
till they are scattered among the spectators.
Meanwhile, all that is required
is done to their handkerchiefs. It is
not absolutely necessary that they
should be washed; for folding, pressing,
and a little eau-de-Cologne, would
complete the preparation; but granting
that they are washed, there is
still no difficulty, though this mystifies
the spectators, who have the idea that
drying is a long affair; for it may be
effected in a minute or two by a machine
that is readily obtained. The
box brought out has them deposited
in it, but as it is double, one interior
is first shown, which, of course, contains
nothing, for the inner drawer
holding the handkerchiefs remains in the case; but when a
few sounds are uttered, and the professor touches a secret
spring behind, which disengages the inner box, he draws it
out with the outer one, and presents the handkerchiefs to
the audience. In the diagram <span class="smcapa">A</span>, the box is shown as empty.
At <span class="smcapa">B</span>, we have a representation of the box containing the
handkerchiefs. It is only necessary to add that the box is
very nicely made; the part within the other drawn out to
the end, defies detection. <em>See Trick No.</em> 65.</p>

<p>The preparation of coffee, milk, and sugar, may be easily
explained; for if the vessels containing respectively the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
unground coffee, the rape-seed, and the horse-beans, always
placed under a cover, be put on a part of the table having
a circular trap-door&mdash;and for this there is full provision in
the cover of the table extending to the floor&mdash;a confederate
may readily substitute one for the other.</p>

<p class="p6">57. THE MAGIC FUNNEL.</p>

<p>This favorite and simple trick is carried out by the assistance
of a double funnel, that is to say, one funnel soldered
into the other so as to leave a space between them for
water, and communicating with the hollow of the funnel by
a hole in the tube. Our drawing will assist the explanation.</p>

<div class="imagl">
<div class="containerl">
<p><img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="120" height="109" alt="" class="alignright" />
<span class="smcapa">S</span> <span class="smcapa">S</span>, space for water between the funnels, which is
filled by stopping end of tube <span class="smcapa">T</span> with the finger: the
water flows in and out at <span class="smcapa">K</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">N</span>, a pin-hole at the top, which is covered with the
finger. When the funnel is prepared for use, every
time the finger is withdrawn water flows out from tube <span class="smcapa">T</span>.</p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The funnel is always prepared before the
audience by pouring in water, occasionally stopping the
end of the pipe <span class="smcapa">T</span> with the finger, so that the inner space
may be filled; whilst this is being effected the conjuror
must fill up the time with a philosophical disquisition on
funnels, all ending, however, in the fact, that if there is a
hole in a vessel the water will flow out. One of the audience
is now requested to step up to the table, and you
proceed to draw water from his hair, ears, eyes, &amp;c., as
every time the finger is withdrawn from the hole <span class="smcapa">N</span> the
pressure of the air is admitted, and the water flows out.</p>


<p class="p6">58. THE MAGIC BOTTLE.</p>

<p>This trick, if well managed, is one of the most wonderful
that can be performed in a drawing-room without
apparatus; but it requires dexterity at the conclusion.</p>

<p>The person performing the trick offers to pour from a
common wine bottle, port wine, sherry, milk, and champagne
in succession, and in any order.</p>

<p>To accomplish the trick, you must make solutions of the
following chemicals, and label the bottles with numbers,
thus:</p>

<p>1. A saturated solution of the sulphocyanate of potash.</p>

<p>2. A diluted solution of the above&mdash;one part of the solution
to four of water.</p>

<p>3. A saturated solution of nitrate of lead.</p>

<p>4. A saturated solution of perchloride of iron.</p>

<p>5. A saturated solution of bicarbonate of potash.</p>

<p>6. Sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>7. A clear solution of gum-arabic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Procure a champagne bottle, and wash it out well, then
pour three teaspoonfuls of No. 4 into it. As the quantity
is very small, it will not be observed, especially if you are
quick in your movements. Pour some distilled or rain
water into a common water-bottle or jug, and add a tablespoonful
of No. 7 to it; then set it aside ready for use.</p>

<p>Provide some wine glasses of four different patterns,
and into one pattern pour the solution marked No. 1, into
another that marked No. 2, and so on for Nos. 3 and 5.
Return the solutions to their respective bottles, and arrange
the glasses on a small tray, remembering the solutions that
were poured into each pattern.</p>

<p>Everything being ready, take the champagne bottle that
you have prepared, from two or three others, and holding it
up to show the company that it is clear and empty, you
must desire some person to hand you the water bottle or
jug, and then fill up the bottle with the water.</p>

<p>Pour some of the contents of the bottle into an unprepared
glass, in order to show that it is water; then say,
"change to champagne," and pour the liquid from the bottle
into one of the glasses rinsed with No. 5; then pour into a
glass rinsed with No. 1, and it will change to port wine;
but if poured into No. 3, it will change to milk, and if into
No. 2, it will produce sherry. Be careful in pouring the
fluid from the bottle, not to hold it high above the glasses,
but to keep the mouth of it close to the edges of the glasses,
otherwise persons will observe that it undergoes change of
color after it is poured into the wine glasses, and on this
account the glasses should be held rather high.</p>

<p>∵ As the solutions used in the above trick are deleterious,
they must not be left about in the way of children,
and of course the fluid in the wine glasses must not even
be tasted; but if any of the company wish to drink the
wines you have made, then the tray must be adroitly
exchanged for another with the proper wines placed on it.</p>

<p>This is an excellent parlor trick if well managed, and is
not difficult to comprehend.</p>


<p class="p6">59. THE BOTTLE TRICK.</p>

<p>The chemical method of performing this delusion has
been already explained, the mechanical one will be easily
understood from the "Magic Funnel Trick." It is usually
carried out with a bottle, the body of which is constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of tin, the neck of glass; the body is divided into sundry
compartments, three of which are sufficient, with a center
one, for ordinary use: by cutting the bottle in two, the
arrangement will be understood as shown beneath.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="blockquotea"><p>O, center of bottle, from
which milk may be poured.
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="107" height="100" alt="" class="aligncenter" />
1, 2, 3, compartments holding
port, sherry, and alcohol.</p></div>
</div>

<hr class="r20" />

<p>It must be understood that little tubes from each compartment
terminate in the neck, and they are filled with their
respective liquids by the pear-shaped vessel already explained.
Each compartment is perforated with a little hole
at the top, so that when the fingers are placed over them
(as on the holes of a flute) the liquid cannot run out on
inverting the bottle.</p>

<p>On showing the trick, the performer alludes to his wonderful
bottle full of the milk of human kindness, which he
pours out carefully from the center compartment, keeping
the three holes tight with his fingers, the center being filled
and emptied in the ordinary manner; after pouring out and
handing round a few glasses of milk, he may pour the rest
into a jug, in the bottom of which some milk has been
already placed, so that the company may believe the bottle
was originally filled with it; he may now wash out the
bottle (that is to say, the center compartment), still keeping
his fingers over the holes, and for the sake of a little
mystification put the bottle upright under a hat, commanding
the bottle to change its temperance habits. He may
now ask the company to call for port, sherry, gin, brandy,
noyeau, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The sherry and port are poured from their compartments,
the spirit supplies the others, as a number of wine-glasses
can be prepared with drops of burnt sugar for brandy, syrup
and juniper for gin. A small drop of oil of almonds or
other flavoring materials may be used for the different
liquors. A thick wine-glass must be employed, holding a
very small quantity of fluid.</p>

<p>A magic coffee-pot may be arranged in a similar manner,
with three compartments to hold hot tea, coffee, and punch;
the middle compartment may hold the tea and coffee berries,
into which the assistant may pour by mistake the contents
of the bottle labeled "<em>Ink</em>." The performer, after scratching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
his head, as if in deep thought, will take a lump of
whiting and powder up, placing it in the center compartment,
which can be fastened up with a cork or proper lid.
Then, if the holes from the compartments terminate in the
handle and the pipes in the spout, when the fingers are
removed the three liquids pour out separately, as in the
Bottle Trick. This mode of showing the trick is good,
because, however large your audience, you can provide
everybody with something to drink, and it is displayed with
great effect by Signor Blitz, and Wyman.</p>


<p class="p6">60. THE MAGIC QUARTER.</p>

<p>Procure a small round box, about one inch deep, to which
fit accurately a quarter or cent: line the box with any dark
paper (crimson, for instance), and paste some of it on one
side of the coin, so that when it lies in the lower part of
the box it shall appear like the real box. This quarter or
cent is concealed in the hand, and before performing the
trick, it will heighten the effect if a number of single quarters
or cents are hidden about the room, in places known to
yourself. Having borrowed a coin, you dexterously place
this on one side, and substitute the prepared one; and putting
it gravely into the box, ask all to be sure they have
seen it enter: when the lid is on, shake up and down&mdash;the
noise betrays the metal; now command it to disappear,
and shake laterally from side to side; as the quarter is
made to fit accurately, no noise is apparent&mdash;the coin seems
to be gone; in proof of which you open the box, and display
the interior; the paper on the coin conceals it, whilst
you direct the audience to look into a book, or a pair of
slippers, for the missing quarter; the prepared coin can be
slipped out, and the box handed round for examination, in
which, of course, nothing will be found. This trick may be
repeated two or three times with the greatest success, and
is so simple that nobody guesses the manner of performance.</p>


<p class="p6">61. TO CHANGE A DIME TO A QUARTER.</p>

<p>This is quite a simple parlor trick, but when performed
with dexterity is calculated to produce much astonishment
at an evening party. In fact, it surprises on account of
its very simplicity. Procure two pieces of marbled paper
about seven inches square, and having put the marble backs
of the paper together, cut them the shape of diagram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Fig. 1. Be very careful to have them exactly the same size, as
the success of the trick depends in a great measure upon
the regularity of the paper. After cutting the paper in the
manner described, place a dime in the center of one of the
pieces at the place marked <span class="smcapa">A</span>, then fold it carefully over at
the crease on the side marked <span class="smcapa">B</span>, and also again at the side
marked <span class="smcapa">C</span>. When you have done this turn down the end
marked <span class="smcapa">D</span> upon the center <span class="smcapa">A</span>, and again fold over on <span class="smcapa">E</span>.
When this is accomplished, you will discover that you
have formed a small parcel the same shape as Fig. 2, with a
dime in the center. You must then place a quarter of a dollar
in the center of the other piece of paper, and fold it up
exactly the same size and shape as the first piece. When
you have done this, gum the two parcels together at the
back of the ends marked <span class="smcapa">F</span>, in Fig. 2, and the sides will be
so even that both parcels will appear as one. You can then
open the side of the paper containing the dime and show
it to your audience, at the same time informing them that
you are going to open a mint on a small plan, and coin a
quarter from a dime. Having done this, mutter some cabalistic
words and dexterously turn over the side containing
the quarter, and upon opening the paper, to the astonishment
of the company, instead of a dime they will behold
a genuine quarter. I have seen much merriment created
by this excellent feat.</p>

<p class="p6">62. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAGICIAN'S TABLE.</p>

<p>When a secret confederate is required, have a table four
and a half feet long, two feet eight inches high, two feet
nine inches wide, with a curtain round it, twenty-two inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
deep. In the top of this table are several secret square
holes, of different sizes, from three to five inches across;
these having covers which exactly fit, and hung upon concealed
hinges, so that they may be let down; but when
lying flat, the top of the table appears to present a perfect
surface. Under this surface are buttons, which prevent
those lids from falling down when not made use of. Under
the top of the table is fastened a box, or drawer, open at
the top, and at the side which is farthest from the spectators.
This box is about twenty inches deep, and concealed
by the curtain; and in this box is placed the secret agent
who assists the performer.</p>


<p class="p6">63. WYMAN'S GUN TRICK.</p>

<p>Having provided yourself with a fowling-piece, permit
any person to load it, retaining for yourself the privilege
of putting in the ball, to the evident satisfaction of the
company, but instead of which you must provide yourself
with an artificial one made of black lead, which may be
easily concealed between your fingers, and retain the real
ball in your possession, producing it after the gun has been
discharged; and a mark having been previously put upon
it, it will instantly be acknowledged. This trick is quite
simple, as the artificial ball is easily reduced to a powder
on the application of the ramrod; besides the smallness of
the balls preclude all discovery of the deception.</p>


<p class="p6">64. THE HATCHED BIRD.</p>

<p>Separate an egg in the middle as nearly as possible,
empty it, and then, with a fine piece of paper and a little
glue, join the two halves together, having first put a live
canary bird inside it, which will continue unhurt in it for
some time, provided you make a small pinhole in the shell to
supply the bird with air; have, also, a whole egg in readiness.
Present the two eggs for one to be chosen; put the
egg, which contains the bird, next to the person who is to
choose, and for this purpose be sure to select a lady; she
naturally chooses the nearest to her, because, having no
idea of the trick to be performed, there, is no apparent reason
to take the further one; at any rate, if the wrong one
be taken, you do not fail in the trick, for you break the egg,
and say, "You see that this egg is fair and fresh madam;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
so you would have found the other, if you had chosen it.
Now, do you choose to find in it a mouse, or a canary bird?"
She naturally declares for the bird; nevertheless, if she
ask for the mouse, there are means to escape; you ask the
same question of several ladies, and gather the majority of
votes, which, in all probability, will be in favour of the bird
which you then produce.</p>


<p class="p6">65. THE APPLE AND ORANGE TRICK.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;">
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="560" height="466" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Have a box made with a drawer fitted to it as in the
figure No. 2, marked A. The back part of the drawer B,
which slides into the box A, has no end piece; then have
another drawer made, marked C, open at the top, that will
fit the drawer B rather easy, when put into it the sides and
ends of the drawer C, made of rather thin wood, with their
end and sides sloping towards the sides of the drawer B,
so that when it is in the drawer B, it cannot be discovered
without minute examination; then push them both into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
box A, and have a small hole bored through the top of the
box A, in which you put a small pin with a flat top, as
marked D in the plate; this pin is so long that it will just
catch drawer C, inside of the box A, to prevent it from
coming out with the drawer B, when not necessary to be
exposed. It is now ready to perform experiments with.
You are aware, as has already been described, that the
drawer B is open at the inner end, consequently, when that
with the loose drawer C is pushed into the box A, and you
put the pin D in its place, the drawer B may be pulled out,
or pushed back, without interruption; but if you remove
the pin out of the box, C will come out inside of the drawer
B without the trick being discovered; it being understood
that the false drawer C is invariably concealed from the
spectator. When the drawer C is in the box A, and the
drawer B has been drawn out, the end of the drawer C will
then appear as if it was the end of the drawer B as represented
in the plate. You can then show it to the company,
and you may also measure the inside of the drawer B, and
the outside of the box A, and convince them that, apparently,
nothing is concealed. Care must be taken in pulling
the drawer C out alone, that the drawer C will not slip from
the bottom of the drawer B, which otherwise would prevent
it from being pushed back. A little catch may be affixed
in the bottom of the drawer C, so as to prevent the same
from slipping out of its place.</p>

<p><em>To Perform the Experiment.</em>&mdash;Fill, privately, the drawer C
with fruit, close the drawer B, and exhibit it; then pull the
drawer B out, alone, as represented in the plate, figure 2,
which will convince the spectators that it is empty. When
you have satisfied them on that point, slide back the drawer
B, then place the left hand on the secret pin D, and take it
out; then with the right hand pull out the drawer B, with
the secret drawer C, which is full of fruit, to the great
astonishment of the company; take the fruit out and present
it to the spectators. This concludes the performance.</p>


<p class="p6">66. ENCHANTED COIN, AS PERFORMED BY PROFESSOR WYMAN.</p>

<p>Put fifteen pieces of money into a hat, take out five and
mysteriously pass them back into the hat and it covered.
To do this trick you must have in your left hand a plate,
and under the plate and in your left hand have previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
placed five pieces of coin such as you will have placed in
the hat; after you have counted the fifteen pieces into the
hat, you then ask the person whom you have selected from
the audience to assist you in performing the tricks, to count
the money out of the hat into the plate, to see that there is
no mistake, after which you turn the money out of the plate
into the hat, and at the same time let fall the five pieces
you have secreted in your hand under the plate; you then
ask him to draw out five pieces, which will still leave fifteen,
you take the five that is drawn out and place them in a
drawer (see the orange and apple trick), then you go
through the magic words, <em>Presto</em>, <em>Pacillo</em>, <em>Pass</em>; you then
open the drawer, (after placing your finger on the spring to
hold the inside drawer in which the five pieces were placed,)
and show the audience that the five pieces are gone; you
then tell him to get the hat and see how many pieces are in
it; he gets the hat, and to the surprise of all, he counts
the original number, fifteen.</p>


<p class="p6">67. MYSTERIOUS COIN, OR HOW TO MAKE DOLLARS PASS THROUGH A
WINE GLASS, A CHINA PLATE, A TABLE, AND FALL INTO THE HAND.</p>

<p>After performing trick 40, (p. 27,) you may address the
company again, and say: "I will show you the nature of
this trick, if you will only look sharp enough to see how
it is done. Therefore, watch closely, and if you have <em>very</em>
penetrating eyes, you may see the money go through
this glass and fall upon the plate, and from that through
the table into my hand. I will do it deliberately, so that
you may have every opportunity of detecting the deception,
which will make you as wise as myself."</p>

<p>Now you take a plate and place it on the table, place
upon that a wine glass upside down, and take the empty
leathern case and hold it before the audience, to convince
them that nothing is inside. Place it, in a careless manner,
over the riveted money, which you had before put a
little aside from the view of the spectators. Place a
small ball on the bottom of the glass, then take the case
with the concealed coins therein, and place them over
the ball, which will be secreted therein. Now tell the
company to keep a sharp look out, and they may discover
the whole process. Take the loose coins and throw them on
the table; bring them again under the table, and exchange
them for a ball previously deposited on the shelf, and lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the same upon the table. Remove the case alone, which,
of course, will leave the money exposed on the top of the
glass. "Now," says the performer, "I presume that you have
discovered the whole mystery; but if not, I will give you
another opportunity, and will return the money whence it
came." Cover the money with the case, and bring the ball
which you previously exposed to the spectator under the
table, and exchange it for the money on the shelf, which
you again toss upon the table. Remove the case with the
coins concealed therein, and the ball will appear on the top
of the glass, as at first. Our performer makes the following
concluding speech: "Now, as you have, I suppose, discovered
the whole mystery, I hope, ladies, that <em>you</em> will not
set up an opposition line against me; since, if you do, you
will very seriously injure my pockets, and, of course,
<em>attract</em> all the company, and leave me in an empty house
with empty pockets."</p>


<p class="p6">68. PROFESSOR WYMAN'S GREAT TRICK OF THE EGYPTIAN FLUIDS, OR
IMPOSSIBILITIES ACCOMPLISHED.</p>

<p>Mix wine and water together, then separate them by means
of a red and white tape. To perform this trick you must
have three covers (tin) made, of an obeliatic form, terminating
at about one inch and a half on top, upon the top of two
of these covers is soldered a piece of thick brass, copper,
or lead, say about a quarter of an inch in thickness, in the
center make a hole about the same in diameter, about two
inches from the top, and on the inside will be a partition or
floor, through the center of which make a small a hole, (this
partition must be water tight.) Previous to performing the
trick fill the two covers (the tops of them) one with water,
the other with wine, then cork them well which excludes the
air, consequently keeps the liquid from coming out at the
small hole made in the center of the partition, then take two
sound tumblers and put about as much water in one as there
is water in one of the covers, place the cover over that, the
tumbler that has the water, then put about the same quantity
of wine in the other tumbler, as there is in the other cover,
and place that cover over it; now have a tumbler with a hole
through the center of the bottom (made with a drill), have
this hole closed with a long peg from the under side, then
through your trick table have a small auger hole made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
admit the peg, this tumbler must also be covered with a
similar cover in external appearance; you then take the covers
off the tumblers containing water and wine, and in presence
of the audience mix the two liquids, then pour both
into the tumbler that has the hole through the bottom, place
the tumblers back and cover them over, now lift the tumbler
up containing the mixture that the audience may see it,
(keeping your hand in front of the peg,) place it back with
peg through the hole, cover it over, then take a red and
white tape string that has previously been fastened to a
small stick, and place it in the top of the cover that is over
the false tumbler, then take the end of the red tape, which
has a small wire to it, and after removing the cork from the
cover over the wine, drop the end of the wire into the whole;
the air is then let into the wine, which lets it run down into
the tumblers underneath, do likewise with the white tape,
then reach your hand under the table and draw the peg out
of the tumbler and let the mixture run down into a tumbler
or cup secreted there for that purpose; now remove the
covers and show the audience that the tumbler you poured
the mixture into is empty, and the one you poured it out
of contains it again, which will greatly astonish them.
That accomplished magician, Professor Wyman, has astonished
applauding and delighted thousands in every city
in the United States and Canada, by the performance of
this wonderful experiment.</p>


<p class="p6">69. THE MAGICIAN'S SNOW BALL. ONE OF THE FAKER OF AVA'S FEATS.</p>

<p>Take a cup and fill it with rice, then change it into a handkerchief.
To do this trick you have two cups (tin) made
to fit one within the other, but let the outside cup be about
two inches deeper than the inside one, let the rims be turned
square down all round, but let that of the inside cup be a
trifle larger than the outside one, so that when the tin cover
(which you must also have) is put over them it will fit
sufficiently tight to lift out the inside cup when it is taken
off. Previous to performing this trick you must place in the
bottom of the deep cup a white pocket handkerchief, then
place the other cup in it, after which bring it out in presence
of the audience, then fill the inside cup (which to the
audience appears to be the only cup) with rice, place the
cover over it, after which repeat the mystic words <em>Presto</em>,
<em>Pacillo</em>, <em>Pass</em>, then remove the cover and the inside cup will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
have stuck to it and be concealed from view, now take out
the handkerchief, and it will greatly astonish those who see
it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 185px;">
<img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="185" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Is a very surprising little fancy, and is calculated to
create much astonishment in
the parlor or drawing room.
To perform this trick, take a
piece of black silk thread or
horse hair, about two feet
long, and fasten to each end
of the same bent hooks of a
similar color. When unobserved,
fasten the hooks in
the back part of your pantaloon-legs,
about two inches
below the bend of the knees.
Then place the cane (it should
be a dark one and not too
heavy), within the inner part
of the thread, as represented
in the engraving, and by a
simple movement of the legs,
you can make the cane dance about, and perform a great
variety of fantastic movements. At night your audience
cannot perceive the thread, and apparently the cane will
have no support whatever. The performer should inform
the company before commencing this trick, that he intends
to magnetize the cane, and by moving his hands as professors
of magnetism do, the motion of the legs will not be
noticed.</p>


<p class="p6">71. PROFESSOR WYMAN'S MODE OF PERFORMING THE EGG BAG TRICK.</p>

<p>Take a bag and exhibit it to the audience, turn the bag inside
out, then back again, after which take several eggs out
of it. To perform this trick, have you a bag about a half
yard wide, and about five eighths deep, made of black cambric,
then take strips of the same cloth about three inches
wide and sew them on each side of the strip lengthwise of
the bag, these are called cells, it is in these that the eggs
are placed; let the end of the cells be closed at the mouth
of the large bag, so that the mouth of the cells will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the reverse of that of the large bag, these are filled with
eggs made of wood, with the exception of one or two
natural eggs, which you take out first, and break, to convince
the audience that they are genuine. When you turn
the bag you keep these cells next to you, and as the large
bag is turned upside down, the eggs are in the bottom of
the cells at the mouth of the large bag. The performer will
then catch the bag just above the eggs, and give it a few
wraps across the other hand, to convince the audience that
there is nothing in it, after which he turns the bag again
and takes out several eggs, which to the audience is a great
mystery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this account of conjuring, I have purposely avoided
such tricks as require expensive apparatus. Such apparatus
is either entirely beyond a boy's reach, or at all events
he ought not to be encouraged in the notion of spending
much money on objects of no real use. A boy of any ingenuity
will make the greater part of the apparatus himself,
or at least he can do the painting and polishing of his
machinery. I have mentioned no machinery that need cost
more than a dollar at the outside, and not that, if a boy is
acquainted with the use of tools. It has also been my
especial care to introduce only such experiments as are
adapted for performance at the parlor or drawing-room table
or fireside, and by imparting interesting facts, to stimulate
the young experimentalist to inquire into the laws that
regulate them; by aiding him to acquire dexterity of practice,
to smoothe the road to the development of principles;
and, above all, to enable him to escape an imputation which
every boy of spirit would consider the depth of disgrace&mdash;that

<h2><a name="TRICKS_AND_DECEPTIONS_WITH_CARDS" id="TRICKS_AND_DECEPTIONS_WITH_CARDS"></a>TRICKS WITH CARDS.</h2>


<p>Although proficiency in games with cards, is, in our
opinion, a most pernicious accomplishment for youth, and
one which cannot be too severely reprobated, we do not
consider <span class="smcapa">SLEIGHT-OF-HAND TRICKS</span> with a pack of cards, at
all objectionable, but rather a source of much harmless
amusement; and, under this impression, we do not hesitate
to insert the following series of excellent deceptions and
sleight-of-hand tricks.</p>

<p>Playing cards are believed to have been invented in
Spain as early as the fourteenth century; for, in 1378, John
the First, king of Castile, forbade card-playing in his dominions,
in an edict which is anterior to any similar
legislative measure in other parts of Europe. The figures
upon the cards themselves, add to the strength of the
supposition; for the suits answering to those of spades
and clubs have not the same inverted heart and trefoil
shape which ours of the present day display, but <em>espadas</em>,
or swords, and <em>bastos</em>, or cudgels, or clubs; so that in fact
we retain their names, though we have altered the figures.
At the present time, too, cards are a favorite diversion of
the Spaniards, and the monopoly of selling them is vested
in the hands of the sovereign.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry the Seventh, card-playing was
a very fashionable court amusement in England. The
cards then used, differed materially in their figures from
those now in vogue, as instead of clubs, spades, diamonds,
and hearts, they had rabbits, pinks, roses, and the flowers
called columbines, upon them; as also bells, hearts, leaves,
acorns, deer, &amp;c. Let us now turn to the tricks that
can be played with cards.</p>

<p>In accordance with my rule, I shall lay the principal
stress on card tricks that require no apparatus, and may
be performed with ordinary cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">1. TO MAKE THE PASS.</p>

<p>This is a necessary beginning for card tricks. "Making
the pass," is the technical term for shifting either the top
or the bottom card to any place in the pack that you like.
It is almost impossible to describe it, and I can only say
that it will be learned better in five minutes from a friend,
than in as many hours from a book. As, however, a friend
is not always to be found who can perform the pass,
I will endeavor to describe it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="300" height="231" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The cards are held in both hands, right hand underneath
and left above, as in the engraving, where, as the <em>bottom</em>
card is to be raised to the top, the little finger is seen between
that card and those above it. By a quick movement
of the right hand, the bottom card is slipped away towards
the left, and is placed upon the top card, under shadow
of the left hand, which is raised for the moment to allow of
its passage.</p>

<p>This movement must be assiduously practiced before
it is exhibited in public, as nothing looks more awkward
than to see it clumsily performed, in which case two or
three cards generally tumble on the floor.</p>


<p class="p6">2. TO TELL A CARD BY ITS BACK.</p>

<p>While shuffling the pack, cast a glance at the bottom
card, make the pass, and bring it to the top. Continue to
shuffle, and lay upon it by degrees as many cards as you
like, say six. Then lay the pack on the table, face downwards,
and divide it into seven heaps, beginning at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
bottom, and leave the seventh heap larger than any of
the others.</p>

<p>When you have done this, take one card from the top of
the seventh heap, appear to calculate, and lay it, face
upwards, on one of the other heaps. Do so with five more
cards, thus leaving your slipped card at the top of the
seventh heap. You then announce that by the aid of the
six cards you will name the seventh. You name it accordingly,
after carefully studying the other cards, and on asking
a spectator to take it up, it will be seen that you are right.</p>

<p>If you place five cards above the slipped card, you will
lay out six heaps, and if eight cards, there will of course
be nine heaps.</p>


<p class="p6">3. THE CARD NAMED WITHOUT BEING SEEN.</p>

<p>As in the last trick, cast a glance at the bottom card, say
the ace of spades. Lay out the pack in as many heaps as
you like, noting where that one is laid which contains that
bottom card. Ask any one to take up the top card of any
heap, look at it, and replace it. You then gather up the
heaps apparently by chance, but you take care to put the
heap containing the bottom card upon the card which has
been chosen. You then give any one the cards to cut, and
on counting them over, the card that immediately follows
the ace of spades is the card chosen.</p>

<p>If by any accident the two cards should be separated
when cut, the upper card of the pack is the chosen one, and
can be picked out with seeming care.</p>


<p class="p6">4. THE CARD TOLD BY THE OPERA GLASS.</p>

<p>Make out a table, such as is given in Fig. 1, and place
it in an opera-glass, so that the figures will be visible when
you look through it. For convenience, I have made mine as
seen in Fig. 2, the numbers 1, 2, 3 in each series being
understood. The best plan is to write the numbers, or cut
them out of a book, and paste them on a circular piece of
cardboard, which must then be soaked in oil, so as to make
it semi-transparent. The light will then easily pierce
through it, and the figures will be better visible than if it
were opaque.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Fig. 2 contains as much matter as
Fig. 1, and that two thirds of the figures are saved by it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 268px;">
<img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="268" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These preliminaries being arranged, tell any one to take
any twenty-seven cards out of a pack, and to think of any
one of them. Deal them into three heaps, and ask him
in which heap it is, and what number from the top he would
like it to come after the third deal. Suppose he chooses it
to be the twenty-sixth card, you take up your opera-glass
and look for the number 26. This you will find last but one,
arranged thus&mdash;26 213 The meaning is, that if the chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
card is to be the twenty-sixth, the heap in which it was
found must be for the first time placed second, the second
time first, and the last time third. So you pick up the cards,
taking care to keep that heap number two. You again
deal them in three heaps, and this time you place the heap
in which is the chosen card at the top, being number one.
Deal them a third time, and on gathering up the heaps, place
it at the bottom.</p>

<p>Then, on counting from the top, the chosen card will be
found to be the twenty-sixth.</p>


<p class="p6">5. THE FOUR KINGS.</p>

<p>Take the four kings out of a pack of cards, and also two
other court cards, which are not to be shown. Spread out
the kings before the spectators, but conceal the two
court cards between the third and fourth kings. Lay the
cards face downwards on the table. Take off the bottom
card, which is, of course one of the kings; show it as if by
accident, and place it on the top. Take the next card,
(which is one of the court cards,) and place that in the
middle of the pack. Take the third card, (i. e., the second
court card,) and place that also near the middle of the pack.
There will then be one king at the top and three at the bottom.
Ask any one to cut the cards, and to examine them,
when he will find all four kings together in the middle of
the pack.</p>

<p>It is better to use court cards to place between the third
and fourth kings, because if the cards should slip aside,
they would not be so readily distinguished as common
cards.</p>


<p class="p6">6. THE FOUR ACCOMPLICES.</p>

<p>Let a person draw four cards from the pack, and tell him
to think of one of them. When he returns you the four
cards, dexterously place two of them under the pack, and
two on the top. Under those at the bottom you place four
cards of any sort, and then, taking eight or ten from the
bottom cards, you spread them on the table, and ask the
person if the card he fixed on be among them. If he say no,
you are sure it is one of the two cards on the top. You then
pass two cards to the bottom, and drawing off the lowest of
them, you ask if that be not his card. If he again say no,
you take that card up, and bid him draw his card from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
bottom of the pack. If the person say his card is among
those you first drew from the bottom, you must dexterously
take up the four cards that you put under them, and placing
those on the top, let the other two be the bottom cards of
the pack, which draw in the manner before described.</p>


<p class="p6">7. TO TELL THE CARD THOUGHT OF IN A CIRCLE OF TEN.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 230px;">
<img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="230" height="210" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Place the first ten cards of any suit in a circular form, as
in the annexed figure; the ace being counted as one.
Request a person to think of a
number or card, and to touch also
any other number or card; desire
him to add to the number of the
card he touched the number of
the cards laid out, that is, ten;
then bid him count that sum backward,
beginning at the card he
touched, and reckoning that card
at the number he thought of;
when he will thus end it at the
card or number he first thought of, and thereby enable you
to ascertain what that was. For example, suppose he
thought of the number three, and touched the sixth card, if
ten be added to six, it will of course make sixteen; and if
he count that number from the sixth card, the one touched,
in a retrograde order, reckoning three on the sixth, four on
the fifth, five on the fourth, six on the third cards, and so
on; it will be found to terminate on the third card, which
will therefore show you the number the person thought of.
When the person is counting the numbers, he should not, of
course, call them out aloud.</p>


<p class="p6">8. TO GUESS THE CARD THOUGHT OF.</p>

<p>To perform this trick, the number of cards must be divisible
by 3, and it is more convenient that the number should
be odd. Desire a person to think of a card; place the cards
on the table with their faces downward, and, taking them
up in order, arrange them in three heaps, with their faces
upward, and in such a manner that the first card of the
pack shall be first in the first heap, the second the first in
the second heap, and the third the first of the third; the
fourth the second of the first, and so on. When the heaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
are completed, ask the person in which heap the card he
thought of is, and when he tells you, place that heap in the
middle; then turning up the packet, form three heaps, as
before, and again inquire in which heap the card thought
of is; form the three heaps afresh, place the heap containing
the card thought of again in the center, and ask which
of them contains the card. When this is known, place it
as before, between the other two, and again form three
heaps, asking the same question. Then take up the heaps
for the last time, put that containing the card thought of
in the middle, and place the packet on the table with the
faces downward, turn up the cards till you count half the
number of those contained in the packet; twelve, for example,
if there be twenty-four, in which case the twelfth card
will be the one the person thought of. If the number of
the cards be at the same time odd, and divisible by three,
such as fifteen, twenty-one, twenty-seven, &amp;c., the trick will
be much easier, for the card thought of will always be that
in the middle of the heap in which it is found the third time,
so that it may be easily distinguished without counting the
cards; in reality, nothing is necessary but to remember,
while you are arranging the heap for the third time, the
card which is the middle one of each. Suppose, for example,
that the middle card of the first heap be the ace of spades;
that the second be the king of hearts; and that the third
be the knave of hearts: if you are told that the heap containing
the required card is the third, that card must be
the knave of hearts. You may therefore have the cards
shuffled, without troubling them any more; and then, looking
them over for form's sake, may name the knave of hearts
when it occurs.</p>


<p class="p6">9. TO TELL THE NUMBER OF CARDS BY THE WEIGHT.</p>

<p>Take a pack of cards, say forty, and privately insert
among them two cards rather larger than the others;
let the first be the fifteenth, and the other the twenty-sixth,
from the top. Seem to shuffle the cards, and cut them at
the first long card; poise those you have taken off in your
hand, and say, "There must be fifteen cards here;" then
cut them at the second long card, and say, "There are but
eleven here;" and poising the remainder, exclaim, "And
here are fourteen cards." On counting them, the spectators
will find your calculations correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>



<h3>AUDACITY.</h3>

<p>Several <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 't icks'">tricks</ins> may be successfully played by sheer audacity.
I once astonished a whole party by holding a pack
of cards over my head, and naming each. The fact was,
that I was standing exactly opposite a large mirror, in
which the cards were reflected, while the spectators, having
their backs to the mirror, suspected nothing.</p>

<p>I will give one or two tricks that depend on audacity for
success.</p>


<p class="p6">10. THE CARD FOUND AT THE SECOND GUESS.</p>

<p>Offer the cards to any one, and let him draw one. You
then hold the cards behind your back, and tell him to place
his card on the top. Pretend to make a great shuffling, but
only turn that card with its back to the others, still keeping
it at the top. Then hold up the cards with their faces
towards the spectator, and ask him if the bottom card is
his. While doing so, you inspect his card at your leisure.
He of course denies it, and you begin shuffling again furiously.
"Let me do that," he will probably say; so, as
you are perfectly acquainted with his card, you let him
shuffle as much as he likes, and then, when you get the
cards back again, shuffle until his card is at the bottom.
Then pass them behind your back, make a ruffling noise
with them, and show him his own card at the bottom.</p>


<p class="p6">11. THE CARD FOUND UNDER THE HAT.</p>

<p>Have a needle stuck just inside your sleeve. Hand the
cards, &amp;c., just as in the preceding trick, and tell the taker
to put the card on the top. Take out the needle, and prick
a hole nearly through the top <em>left</em>-hand corner. Replace the
needle, shuffle the cards, or let any one shuffle them. Place
the pack on the table, cover them with a hat, and the marked
card will be known by a little raised knob on the <em>right</em>-hand
top corner. Draw out card by card, saying whether
it is that card or not, until you come to the marked one,
which you throw on the table carelessly, and when you are
about taking out another card, stop suddenly, and pretend
to find, by some magic process, that it is the chosen card.</p>


<p class="p6">12. TO CALL THE CARDS OUT OF THE PACK.</p>

<p>Tell the spectators that you will call six cards out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
pack. Secure a card, say the ace of spades, in the palm
of your hand. Throw the pack on the table, face downwards,
spread out the cards, give one of the spectators your
conjuring wand, and tell him, when you name a card to
touch one, which you will take up.</p>

<p>First name the ace of spades. He touches a card, which
you take up without showing the face of it. This card may
be, say the eight of diamonds. Put it into your left hand,
and place it upon the ace of spades, which is already there,
so that the two look like one card. Then call for the eight
of diamonds. Another card is touched, say the queen of
clubs. This you put with the others, and, after pretending
to calculate, call for the queen of clubs.</p>

<p>Proceed in this manner until six cards have been drawn.
Then substitute the last card drawn (which is of course a
wrong one) for the ace of spades, and conceal it in the palm
of your hand. Then strew the others on the table, and
while the eyes of the spectators are fixed upon them, get
rid of the card in your left hand.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to ask some one to write down the names
of the cards as they are called, and then to have the list
called over, in order that every one may see that there has
been no mistake.</p>


<p class="p6">13. HEADS AND TAILS.</p>

<p>While you are shuffling the cards, contrive to arrange
quietly all their heads one way, or as many as possible, rejecting
all the diamonds except the king, queen, knave, and
seven, and passing them to the bottom. Put the pack upon
the table, take off a number of the upper cards, and offer
them for some one to choose a card from. While he is
looking at it, turn the cards round, and offer them to him, in
order that he may replace it. Shuffle the cards, and on
looking them over, the chosen card will be standing with
its head one way, while the others are reversed.</p>


<p class="p6">14. THE SURPRISE.</p>

<p>When you have discovered a card, the following plan
will make a <em>striking</em> termination to the trick. Get the card
to the bottom of the pack, and tell one of the spectators to
hold the cards by one corner as tightly as he can. Give
them a sharp rap with your finger, not with your hand,
and all the cards will be struck out of his hold, and fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
on the floor, except the bottom card, which will remain
between his finger and thumb. It has a rather more dashing
effect, if you put the chosen card at the top, and strike
them upwards, when the whole pack will fly about the room,
like a flock of butterflies, only leaving the top card in the
person's grasp.</p>


<p class="p6">15. THE REVOLUTION.</p>

<p>Another neat way of finishing a trick is as follows. Get
the card to the top of the pack; and taking care that all
the cards are even, drop the pack on the floor, taking care
just as you let go, to slip the top card a little off the rest of
the pack. In falling, the resistance of the air will turn the
card over, and it will rest with its face upwards on the top
of the pack.</p>


<p class="p6">16. THE SLIPPED CARD.</p>

<p>Ascertain the bottom card of the pack; hold the cards
in your left hand, with their faces downwards. Place your
right hand upon them, and with your right fore finger slide
them slowly over each other, asking some one to stop any
card he chooses, by putting his finger upon it. When he
has done so, open the pack at that card, but while opening
it, make the pass, and bring the bottom card under the one
touched. Hold up the cards, and ask the chooser to be sure
of his card; hand all the cards to him, and let him shuffle
as much as he chooses. Afterwards discover the card in
any manner that you prefer. The following is a good plan.</p>


<p class="p6">17. THE NAILED CARD.</p>

<p>Take a flat-headed nail, and file it down until its point is
as sharp as a needle, and the head quite flat. The nail
should be about half an inch long, or even shorter if anything.
Pass the nail through the center of any card, say
the ace of spades, and conceal it in your left hand.</p>

<p>Take another pack of cards, get the ace of spades to the
bottom, and perform the preceding trick. When the cards
are returned, shuffle them about, and exchange the pierced
card for the other. Put the pierced card at the bottom of
the pack, and throw the cards violently against a door,
when the nail will be driven in by the pressure of the other
cards against its head, and the chosen card will be seen
nailed to the door. The nail should be put through the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the card, so that when the others fall on the floor, it remains
facing the spectators.</p>


<p class="p6">18. TO ASCERTAIN THE NUMBER OF POINTS ON THREE UNSEEN CARDS.</p>

<p>In this amusement the ace counts eleven, the court cards
ten each, and the others according to the number of their
spots.</p>

<p>Ask any one to choose any three cards, and lay them on
the table, with their faces downwards. On each of these
he must place as many as with the number of the card will
make fifteen. He gives you the remaining cards, and when
you have them in your hand, you count them over on the
pretence of shuffling them, and by deducting four, you will
have the number of points on the three cards.</p>

<p>For example, the spectator chooses a four, an eight, and a
king. On the four he places eleven cards, on the eight seven,
and on the king five. There will then be twenty-six cards
left. Deduct from this twenty-six four, and the result will be
twenty-two, which is the number of points on the three cards,
the king counting ten, added to the eight and the four.</p>


<p class="p6">19. TO TELL THE NUMBERS ON TWO UNSEEN CARDS.</p>

<p>As in the preceding trick, the ace counts eleven, and the
court cards ten each. Let the person who chooses the two
cards lay them on the table with their faces downward, and
place on each as many as will make their number twenty-five.</p>

<p>Take the remaining cards and count them, when they will
be found to be just as many as the points in the two cards.
For example, take an ace and a queen, <em>i. e.</em> eleven and ten,
and lay them on the table. On the ace you must put fourteen
cards, and on the queen fifteen. There will be then
fifteen cards in one heap, and sixteen in the other: these
added together make thirty-one cards: these subtracted
from the number of cards in the pack, <em>i. e.</em> fifty-two, leave
twenty-one, the joint number of the ace and queen.</p>


<p class="p6">20. THE KNAVES AND THE CONSTABLE.</p>

<p>Select the four knaves from a pack of cards, and one of
the kings to perform the office of constable. Secretly place
one of the knaves at the bottom of the pack, and lay the
other three, with the constable, down upon the table. Proceed
with a tale to the effect that three knaves once we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>re
to rob a house; one got in at the parlor window (putting a
knave at the bottom of the pack, taking care not to lift the
pack so high that the one already at the bottom can be
seen); one effected his entrance at the first floor window
(putting another knave in the middle of the pack); and
the other, by getting on the parapet from a neighboring
house, contrived to scramble in at the garret window (placing
the third knave at the top of the pack); the constable
vowed he would capture them, and closely followed the last
knave (putting the king likewise upon the top of the pack).
Then request as many of the company to cut the cards as
please; and tell them that you have no doubt the constable
has succeeded in his object, which will be quite evident,
when you spread out the pack in your hands; as the king
and three knaves will, if the trick is neatly performed, be
found together. A very little practice only is required to
enable you to convey a knave or any other card secretly to
the bottom of the pack.</p>


<p class="p6">21. THE PAIRS RE-PAIRED.</p>

<p>Tell out twenty cards in pairs, and ask ten people to take
a pair each, and remember them. Take up the pairs in
their order, and lay them on the table in order, according to
the accompanying table, which forms a memoria technica,
and may be construed, "Mutus gave a name to the Coci,"
(a people who have yet to be discovered.)</p>

<p>Arranging these words in your mind on the table, take
the first card of the first pair, lay it on <span class="smcapa">M</span> in Mutus, and the
second on the <span class="smcapa">M</span> in Nomen. The next pair goes entirely in
Mutus, being two <span class="smcapa">U</span>'s. The first card of the second pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
goes on <span class="smcapa">T</span> in Mutus, and the second on <span class="smcapa">T</span> in Dedit; and so
on until all the cards are laid in their places.</p>

<p>Ask each person in succession in which rows his cards
are, and you can immediately point them out. For example,
if he says the second and third row, you point out the
second and fourth cards in those rows, because they both
represent the letter <span class="smcapa">E</span>. If another says the first and last
rows, you point out the last cards in each, because the cards
represent <span class="smcapa">S</span> in Mutus and <span class="smcapa">S</span> in Cocis. It will be seen that
the whole table consists of ten letters, each repeated,
which will always point out the positions of the pairs if
they are put in the places of those letters. Any number
of bystanders may choose pairs, and to make the trick more
mysterious, the pairs may be placed on the table back
upwards.</p>


<p class="p6">23. THE QUEENS DIGGING FOR DIAMONDS.</p>

<p>Select from a pack the aces, kings, queens, and knaves,
together with four common cards of each suit. Lay down
the four queens in a row, and say, "Here are four queens
going to dig for diamonds. (<em>Lay a common diamond over each
queen.</em>) They each took a spade with them (<em>place a common
spade on each diamond</em>) and dug until they were nearly tired.
Their four kings, thinking that they might be attacked by
robbers, sent four soldiers to keep guard. (<em>Lay an ace on
each spade.</em>) Evening came, and the queens had not returned,
so the kings, fearing that they might have come to harm,
became uneasy and set off themselves. (<em>Place a king on
each ace.</em>) They were only just in time, for as they came
along, they met their queens being carried off by four villains
(<em>lay a knave on each king</em>), who, although only armed
with clubs (<em>place a common club on each knave</em>), had overpowered
the guards and driven them off. But the four kings,
being possessed of bold hearts (<em>lay a common heart over each
king</em>), soon vanquished the villains, and bound them."
Gather up the cards, place the heaps upon each other and
direct some one to cut them. Have them cut four or five
times, and continue to do so until a common heart appears
at the bottom. Then continue the tale, and say, "The party
then returned home in the following order. First the queen,
(<em>lay down the top card</em>) with the diamonds which she had found
(<em>lay down the second card, which will be a diamond</em>) in one hand,
and her spade (<em>the third card will be a spade</em>) in the other, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>,
&amp;c." You continue dealing out the cards in that manner,
and it will be found that they will be in precisely the same
order as when they were taken up.</p>


<p class="p6">24. THE TRIPLE DEAL.</p>

<p>Take any twenty-one cards, and ask some person to
choose one from them. Lay them out in three heaps, and
ask the person who took the card in which heap it is. You
may turn your back while he searches. Gather them up and
put that heap between the other two. Do this twice more,
and the chosen card will always be the eleventh from the
top.</p>


<p class="p6">25. THE QUADRUPLE DEAL.</p>

<p>This is a variation of the preceding. Take twenty-four
cards, and lay them in four heaps. Act as in No. 24, putting
the heap in which is the chosen card second. The
tenth card will be the one thought of.</p>


<p class="p6">26. THE CARD DISCOVERED BY THE TOUCH OR SMELL.</p>

<p>Offer the long card, or any other that you thoroughly
well know; and, as the person who has drawn it holds it in
his hand, pretend to feel the pips or figures on the under side
with your fore finger, or smell it, and then sagaciously declare
what card it is.</p>

<p>If it be the long card, you may give the pack to the person
who drew it, and allow him either to replace it or not.
Then take the pack, and feel whether it be there or not;
shuffle the cards in a careless manner, and without looking
at it, decide accordingly.</p>


<p class="p6">27. THE INGENIOUS CONFEDERACY.</p>

<p>Lay sixteen cards on the table, in four divisions, four
cards in each, with their faces upwards. You then state
that you will leave the room, and, on your return, will name
any one card which may have been touched in your absence,
on one of the company (your confederate) pointing out a
passage from any author to be read to you, on your return,
by any person present. To perform this trick, the cards
should be placed in the order in which they appear in the
cut inserted on the next page, you previously making your
confederate acquainted with your mode of proceeding,
which is thus: The cards are supposed to be divided into
four classes, as A, B, C, D; you likewise agree to class every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>thing
in the world under the four denominations
of biped, quadruped, vegetable,
and mineral: class A stands for bipeds,
B for quadrupeds, C for vegetables, and
D for minerals. Each class must now be
subdivided in the same manner: in class
A, No. 1 is the biped, 2 the quadruped,
3 the vegetable, and 4 the mineral; and
so with the other classes. When performing
the trick, your confederate must
take care to select an appropriate passage.
For example, we will suppose the
card No. 4 to have been touched, and that a volume of
Moore having been presented to your confederate to select
from, he gives the following lines to be read:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Breathes there the <em>slave</em> so lowly,</div>
  <div class="i0">Condemned to <em>chains</em> unholy,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, could he burst his bonds at first,</div>
  <div class="i0">Would pine beneath them slowly?" &amp;c.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first word which can be classed as above is <em>slave</em>, you
may thus be certain that the card touched is in class A, a
slave being a biped. The next word you can fix upon is
<em>chains</em>, which being commonly made of some metal, you rank
in the mineral class, and know that card No. 4 was the one
touched, it being the mineral of the biped class.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 159px;">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="159" height="230" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Supposing the trick to be repeated, as is very likely, and
that a volume of Byron is given to your confederate, who
selects the passage commencing&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Know ye the land, where the cypress and myrtle</div>
  <div class="i0">Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime?" &amp;c.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>you know, "cypress" being the first word that can be
classed, the card touched must be in class C (vegetable),
and the next word "myrtle" being also a vegetable, the card
touched must have been No. 11, which is the vegetable of
the vegetable class. Many appropriate passages may be
easily selected, and your confederate should select a long
passage to be read, as it gives greater scope, and helps to
mislead the rest of the company; for should they imagine
that the card is discovered by the number of lines read, and
they touch the same card again, he can select another passage,
desiring them to read only as many lines as they
choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">29. "HOLD IT FAST."</p>

<p>You commence by asking the most athletic person in company
whether he is nervous; he will most probably answer
in the negative; you then ask whether he thinks he can
hold a card tightly. If he answers, No, ask the question of
some one else, till you obtain an answer in the affirmative.
You then desire the party to stand in the middle of the room,
and holding up the pack of cards, you show him the bottom
card, and request him to proclaim what card it is; he will
say it is the knave of hearts; you then tell him to hold the
card tightly at the bottom, and look to the ceiling. While
he is looking up, you ask him if he recollects his card; if
he says, Yes, desire him to draw it away, and ask him what
it is; he will, of course, answer, the knave of hearts; tell
him he has made a mistake, for if he look at his card, he will
find it to be the knave of spades, which will be the case.
You then give him the remainder of the pack, telling him
that if he looks over it, he will find the knave of hearts in
quite a different situation.</p>

<p>This feat, though it excites much admiration, is very simple.
You procure an extra knave of hearts, and cut it in
half, keeping the upper part, and throwing away the lower.
When commencing your feat, get the knave of spades to
the bottom of the pack, and lay over the upper part of it,
unperceived, your half knave of hearts; and, under pretence
of holding the pack very tight, throw your thumb across
the middle of the knave, so that the joining may not be perceived,
for the legs of those two knaves are so much alike
that there is no danger of detection. You, of course, give
him the legs of the knave of spades to hold, and when he
has drawn the card away, hold your hand so that the faces
of the cards will be turned towards the floor, and take an
opportunity of removing the half-knave: you may vary the
feat by having a half-knave of spades.</p>


<p class="p6">30. THE CHARMED TWELVE.</p>

<p>Let any one take a pack of cards, shuffle, take off the
upper card, and, having noticed it, lay it on the table, with
its face downward, and put so many cards upon it as will
make up twelve with the number of spots on the noted card.
For instance: if the card which the person drew was king,
queen knave, or ten, bid him lay that card, with its face
downward, calling it ten; upon that card let him lay another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
calling it eleven, and upon that card, another, calling it
twelve; then bid him take off the next uppermost card: suppose
it to be nine, let him lay it down on another part of the
table, calling it nine, upon it let him lay another, calling it ten,
upon the latter another, calling it eleven, and upon that
another, calling it twelve; then let him go to the next uppermost
card, and so proceed to lay out in heaps, as before,
until he has gone through with the whole pack.</p>

<p>If there be any cards at the last, that is, if there be not
enough to make up the last noted card, the number twelve,
bid him give them to you; then, in order to tell all the number
of spots contained in all the bottom cards of the heaps,
do thus: from the number of heaps subtract four, multiply
the remainder by thirteen, and, to the product, add the number
of remaining cards, which he gave you; but if there
were but four heaps, then those remaining cards alone will
show the number of spots on the four bottom cards. You
need not see the cards laid out, nor know the number of
cards in each heap, it being sufficient to know the number
of heaps, and the number of remaining cards, if there be
any, and therefore you may perform this feat as well
standing in another room, as if you were present.</p>


<p class="p6">31. THE TRICK OF THIRTY-ONE.</p>

<p>A trick often introduced by "<em>sporting men</em>," for the purpose
of deceiving and making money by it. It is called "thirty-one."
I caution all not to play or bet with a man who introduces
it: for, most probably, if he does not propose betting
on it at first, he will after he gets you interested, and
pretend to teach you all the secrets of it, so that you can
play it with him; and perhaps he will let you beat him if
you should play in fun; but if you bet, he will surely beat
you. It is played with the first six of each suit&mdash;the <em>aces</em>
in one row, the <em>deuces</em> in another, the <em>threes</em> in another; then
the <em>fours</em>, <em>fives</em> and <em>sixes</em>&mdash;all laid in rows. The object now
will be to turn down cards alternately, and endeavor to
make thirty-one points by so turning, or as near to it as
possible, without overrunning it; and the man who turns
down a card, the spots of which make him thirty-one, or so
near it that the other cannot turn down one without overrunning
it, wins. This trick is very deceiving, as all other
tricks are, and requires much practice to be well understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
The persons using it I have known to attach great importance
to it, and say that Mr. Fox, of England, was the first
to introduce it; and that it was a favorite amusement of
his. The chief point of this celebrated trick is to count so
as to end with the following numbers, viz., 3, 10, 17 or 24. For
example, we will suppose it your privilege to commence the
count: you would commence with 3, and your adversary
would add 6, which would make 9; it would then be your
policy to add 1, and make 10; then, no matter what number
he adds, he cannot prevent you counting 17, which
number gives you the command of the trick. We will suppose
he add 6, and make 16; then, you add 1, and make 17,
then he to add 6, and make 23, you add 1, and make 24,
then he cannot possibly add any number to count 31: as
the highest number he can add is 6, which would only count
30, so that you can easily add the remaining 1, or ace, and
make 31. There are, however, many variations to the
trick.</p>


<p class="p6">32. TO TELL THE NAMES OF THE CARD BY THE WEIGHT.</p>

<p>You desire any person to cut a pack of cards as often as
he pleases, and undertake, by weighing each card for a
moment on your finger, not only to tell the color, but the
suit and number of spots, and, if a court-card, whether it
be king, queen, or knave.</p>

<p>You must have two packs of cards exactly alike: one
pack to be constantly in use during the evening in performing
your other tricks; the second, or prepared pack, in
your pocket, which take an opportunity of exchanging, so
that it may be believed that the pack of cards of which you
tell the names is the same as that you have been using with
your other tricks, and which they must know have been
well shuffled.</p>

<p>The manner of preparing your pack (which must be done
previously) is by the following line, which you commit to
memory, the words in italics forming the key:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Eight Kings threa-tened to save nine fair Ladies for one sick Knave.</div>
  <div class="i0"><em>Eight King three ten two seven nine five Queen four ace six Knave</em>,</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>You will perceive that this is a kind of artificial memory,
formed by the circumstances of the initial letter of the words
in the line and the names of the cards being identical, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
well as the near resemblance of some of the words. The
word "threatened" is divided into two words, in order that
it may answer for the three and ten; you should pay attention
to this, or you will be very likely to forget the ten
altogether, which would set you entirely wrong; you should
likewise commit to memory the order in which the suits
come viz.: <em>hearts</em>&mdash;<em>spades</em>&mdash;<em>diamonds</em>&mdash;<em>clubs</em>.</p>

<p>You should now separate the different suits, and lay
them on the table, face upwards, placing heart first, spades
next, diamonds next, and clubs last. Having done so, begin
to sort (to yourself), according to your key: take up the
eight of hearts, placing it in the left hand with its back to
the palm; then the king of spades, which you lay over it,
next the three of diamonds, next the ten of clubs, then the
two of hearts, and so on, until you finish your line, which
will terminate with the knave of hearts. You then take up
the eight of spades, and go on in the same way till you
come to the knave of spades, when you begin again with
the eight of diamonds, and go on until you come to the
knave of diamonds, and beginning again with the eight of
clubs, you go on until you come to the knave of clubs, which
finishes the pack, and which is now ready for use; when
you have made your exchange, and brought forward your
prepared pack, hand it round to be cut.</p>

<p>You now want to know the first card, as a clue to the rest;
and therefore take off the top card, and holding it up between
you and the light, you see what the card is, saying at the
same time, that the old way of performing the trick was by
doing so, but that this was very easily detected.</p>

<p>Having thus obtained a knowledge of the first card,
which we will suppose to be the ten of diamonds, you then
take the next card on your finger, and while pretending to
weigh it, you have time to recollect what is the next
word in your key, to <em>ten'd</em>, which is <em>to</em>&mdash;you consequently
know that this card is a <em>two</em>; you must then recollect what
suit comes after diamonds, which is <em>clubs</em>; you, therefore,
declare the card you are now weighing on your finger to
be the <em>two of clubs</em>; the next will of course be the seven of
hearts, the next to that the nine of spades, and so on as
long as you please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>



<h3>TRICKS WITH CARDS, THAT REQUIRE APPARATUS.</h3>


<p>I shall only give one or two of these tricks, because, in
general, the apparatus required for cards is exceedingly expensive.
Those that I shall give require but little apparatus,
and any boy with the use of his hands can make it.</p>


<p class="p6">33. THE CARDS IN THE VASE.</p>

<p>Make a vase with five divisions, two of which hold an
entire pack of cards, and the remaining three are only large
enough just to admit one card each, as in the figure. A
strong silk thread is fastened at <span class="smcapa">A</span>, passes over the three
little compartments, through the bottom of the vase, and running
over two pulleys, terminates in the weight at <span class="smcapa">B</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_073.jpg" width="348" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Take three cards, say the ace of spades, the ten of diamonds,
and the king of hearts, out of a pack of cards, and
put one into each of the little divisions pressing the thread
down into the bottom of each division. If the cards are
left, the weight will descend, and the string being tightened,
will push the cards upwards. So a kind of trigger shelf is
made, on which the weight rests. The remainder of the
pack you put into division 2.</p>

<p>When you show the trick, you take another pack of cards
exactly like that which is already in the vase, and handing
it to three persons successively, compel them to choose the
ace of spades, the ten of diamonds, and the king of hearts.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Let some one shuffle the cards, and when this is done, put
the pack into division 1. Tell the spectators that when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
have struck three times on the table, the cards will come out
of the vase. At the third stroke, loosen the catch on which
the weight stands, by means of the string that communicates
with your table, and the three cards will rise slowly
up. In order to show that the cards have really vanished
from the pack, take the pack out of division 2 and let
any one examine it.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can draw the thread yourself, by having
a kind of a pedal under your table, to which the other end
of the string is attached, instead of being fastened to the
weight <span class="smcapa">B</span>. If you prefer the weight, you must have a small
shelf for the weight to rest upon, when it has descended sufficiently
low, or the cards will be forced entirely out by the
thread. <span class="smcapa">C</span> is a representation of one of the divisions, showing
the semi-circular cut that is made in them for the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'convinience'">convenience</ins>
of taking out the cards.</p>


<p class="p6">34. THE METAMORPHOSIS.</p>

<p>In this most excellent trick you choose from the pack the
four eights and the two of diamonds; you put the four
eights in your left hand and the two on the table; you take
in the two, placing an eight on the table, and they are all
twos. You exchange the two for the eight, and they all
become black cards; you again exchange the eight for
the two, and they all turn red; and after again exchanging,
you have, as before, the four eights and the two of diamonds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="400" height="223" alt="Fig one" />
</div>

<p>The method of accomplishing this trick is as follows:
Get three plain white cards, exactly like playing cards,
and paint them as in the engraving. Mix them with an ordinary
pack, and when you are searching for the four eights,
with which you say you are going to perform a trick, take
them from the pack, and with them an ordinary eight of
clubs and a two of diamonds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_075.jpg" width="550" height="210" alt="Fig two three" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_075a.jpg" width="550" height="204" alt="Fig four five" />
</div>

<p>Show the cards as in fig. 2, making the spectators observe
that there are the four eights. Put the two of diamonds
behind the eight of clubs, and lay the eight on the
table. The two must be inserted before the eight is removed,
or the mystery of the marking will be apparent.
Close the cards, turn them over, and spread them out, when
they will appear as in Fig. 3. Take in the eight and lay the
two on the table; close the cards, and while shuffling them,
turn card No. 2 the other way upwards. The cards will
then all appear black, as in Fig. 4. Take in the two and remove
the eight, turn them over, and spread them out, when
they will appear all red, as in Fig. 5. Finally, take the
eight, replacing the two on the table, reverse No. 2, and you
will have the four eights and the two of diamonds, just as
they were at first. You must invent plenty of talk during
your changes. If the spectators say that the cards are
double, spread them out, and hold them up to the light, (for
the light cannot penetrate through the places where the
cards are placed over each other,) and if they are still skeptical,
hand them the two of diamonds to look at, and in a
moment or two hand them the eight of clubs, asking them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
whether they would like to examine a black card also.
This will effectually disarm <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'supicion'">suspicion</ins>.</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="p6">35. TO HOLD FOUR KINGS OR FOUR KNAVES IN YOUR HAND, AND TO
CHANGE THEM SUDDENLY INTO BLANK CARDS, AND THEN TO FOUR
ACES.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is necessary to have cards made on purpose for this
trick; half cards, as they may be properly termed, that is,
one half kings or knaves, and the other half aces. When
you lay the aces one over the other, of course nothing but
the kings or knaves can be seen; and on turning the kings
or knaves downward, the four aces will make their appearance.
You must have two perfect cards, one a king or
knave, to put over one of the aces, else it will be seen; and
the other an ace, to lay over the kings or knaves. When
you wish to make them all appear blank, lay the cards a little
lower, and by hiding the aces, they will appear white on
both sides; you may then ask which they wish to have, and
may show kings, aces, or knaves, as they are called for.</p>


<p class="p6">36. TO CHANGE A CARD IN A PERSON'S HAND.</p>

<p>Cut very neatly the spots from a three of spades. Lay
the pierced card on an ace of diamonds, and rub pomatum
on the ace of diamonds through the places which the spades
occupied. Remove the pierced card, and sprinkle the ace
of diamonds with jet powder, which adhering to the pomatum,
will transform the card into a three of spades.</p>

<p>Place the transformed card at the bottom of the pack, and
show a person what card it is. Make him declare it that
every one may hear, then place it on the table, face downwards,
and push it over the cloth to the spectator, which
action will rub off all the jet powder. Tell him to place his
hand on the card. Let a three of spades be at the top of
the pack, and an ace of diamonds the second from the bottom.
Show another person the ace of diamonds, and ask
him to tell the name of the card openly. Put the pack
down, face downwards, and in so doing make the pass, and
bring the three of spades to the bottom.</p>

<p>Tap the hand of the person who is guarding the card, and
then tell him to take up the card and show it to the spectators,
when it will be seen to be the ace of diamonds. Simultaneously,
you take up the pack, and show the three of
spades at the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">37. THE CARD IN THE EGG.</p>

<p>To perform this feat, provide a round hollow stick, about
ten inches long and three quarters of an inch in diameter,
the hollow being three eighths of an inch in diameter. Also,
have another round stick to fit this hollow, and slide in it
easily, with a knob to prevent its coming through. Our
young readers will clearly understand our meaning, when
we say, that in all respects it must resemble a pop-gun, with
the single exception that the stick which fits the tube, must
be of the full length of the tube exclusively of the knob.</p>

<p>Next steep a card in water for a quarter of an hour, peel
off the face of it, and double it twice across, till it becomes
one fourth of the length of a card, then roll it up tightly, and
thrust it up the tube till it becomes even with the bottom.
You then thrust in the stick at the other end of the tube till
it just touches the card.</p>

<p>Having thus provided your magic wand, let it lie on the
table until you have occasion to make use of it, but be careful
not to allow any person handle it.</p>

<p>Now take a pack of cards, and let any person draw one;
but be sure to let it be a similar card to the one which you
have in the hollow stick. This must be done by forcing.
The person who has chosen it will put it into the pack
again, and, while you are shuffling, you let it fall into your
lap. Then, calling for some eggs, desire the person who
drew the card, or any other person in the company, to
choose any one of the eggs. When he has done so, ask if
there be anything in it? He will answer there is not.
Place the egg in a saucer; break it with the wand, and
pressing the knob with the palm of your right hand, the
card will be driven into the egg. Then show it to the spectators.</p>

<p>A great improvement may be made in this feat, by presenting
the person who draws the card with a saucer and a
pair of forceps, and instead of his returning the card to the
pack, desire him to take it by the corner with the forceps
and burn it, but to take care and preserve the ashes; for
this purpose you present him with a piece of paper (prepared
as hereafter described), which he lights at the candle;
but a few seconds after, and before he can set the card on
fire, it will suddenly divide in the middle and spring back,
burning his fingers if he do not drop it quickly. Have another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
paper ready and desire him to try that; when he will
most likely beg to be excused, and will prefer lighting it
with the candle.</p>

<p>When the card is consumed, say that you do not wish to
fix upon any particular person in company to choose an egg,
lest it might be suspected he was a confederate; therefore,
request any two ladies in company to choose each an egg,
and having done so, to decide between themselves which
shall contain the card; when this is done, take a second
saucer, and in it receive the rejected egg, break it with
your wand, and show the egg round to the company; at the
same time drawing their attention to the fact of those two
eggs having been chosen from among a number of others,
and of its not being possible for you to have told which of
them would be the chosen one.</p>

<p>You now receive the chosen egg in the saucer containing
the ashes, and having rolled it about until you have blacked
it a little, blow the ashes from around it into the grate;
you then break the egg with the same wand, when, on
touching the spring, the card will be found in the egg.</p>

<p>The method of preparing the paper mentioned in the
above feat is as follows: Take a piece of letter paper,
about six inches in length and three quarters of an inch in
breadth, fold it longitudinally, and with a knife cut it in the
crease about five inches down; then take one of the sides
which are still connected at the bottom, and with the back
of the knife under it, and the thumb of the right hand over
it, curl it outwards as a boy would the tassels of his kite;
repeat the same process with the other side, and lay them
by for use. When about using them, (but not till then, as
the papers will soon lose their curl if stretched,) draw them
up so as to make them their original length, and turn the
ends over a little, in order that they may remain so; when
set on fire, they will burn for a minute or two, until the
turn-over is burnt out, when the lighted ends will turn over
quickly, burning the fingers of the holder: this part of the
trick never fails to excite the greatest merriment.</p>


<p class="p6">38. THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND LIVRES.</p>

</div>

<p>For this trick, prepare two cards like the accompanying
engraving; and have a common ace and five of diamonds.
Hold down the five of diamonds and the two prepared cards,
as shown in the next engraving; and
say, "A certain Frenchman left fifteen
thousand livres, which are represented
by these three cards, to his three sons;
the two youngest agreed to leave their
five thousand, each of them, in the hands
of the elder, that he might improve it."
While you are telling this story lay the
five on the table, and put the ace in its
place; at the same time artfully change
the position of the other two cards, so
that the three cards appear as in this
engraving. Then, resuming the tale,
relate that "The eldest brother, instead
of improving the money, lost it all by
gaming, except three thousand livres,
as you here see (laying the ace on the table, and taking
up the five). Sorry for having lost the money, he went to
the East Indies with these three thousand, and brought
back fifteen thousand." Then show the cards in the same
position as at first. To render this deception agreeable, it
must be performed with dexterity, and should not be repeated,
but the cards immediately put in the packet; and
you should have five common cards ready to show, if any
one desire to see them.</p>


<h3>HINTS TO AMATEURS.</h3>

<p>The following hints are of considerable importance to the
amateur exhibitor.</p>

<p>1. Never acquaint the company beforehand with the particulars
of the feat you are about to perform, as it will give
them time to discover your mode of operation.</p>

<p>2. Endeavor, as much as possible, to acquire various
methods of performing the same feat, in order that if you
should be likely to fail in one, or have reason to believe
that your operations are suspected, you may be prepared
with another.</p>

<p>3. Never yield to the request of any one to repeat the
same feat, as you thereby hazard the detection of your mode
of operation; but do not absolutely refuse, as that would
appear ungracious. Promise to perform it in a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
way, and then exhibit another which somewhat resembles
it. This maneuver seldom fails to answer the purpose.</p>

<p>4. Never venture on a feat requiring manual dexterity,
till you have previously practiced it so often, as to acquire
the necessary expertness.</p>

<p>5. As diverting the attention of the company from too
closely inspecting your maneuvers is a most important
object, you should manage to talk to them during the whole
course of your proceedings. It is the plan of vulgar operators
to gabble unintelligible jargon, and attribute their feats
to some extraordinary and mysterious influence. There are
few persons at the present day credulous enough to believe
such trash, even among the rustic and most ignorant; but,
as the youth of maturer years might inadvertently be
tempted to pursue this method, while exhibiting his skill
before his younger companions, it may not be deemed superfluous
to caution him against such a procedure. He
may state, and truly, that everything he exhibits can be
accounted for on rational principles, and is only in obedience
to the unerring laws of Nature; and although we
have just cautioned him against enabling the company
themselves to detect his operations, there can be no objection
(particularly when the party comprises many younger
than himself) to occasionally show by what simple means
the most apparently marvelous feats are accomplished.</p>


<p class="p6">CURE FOR TROUBLESOME SPECTATORS.</p>

<p>It will sometimes happen at an early stage of the performance,
that the ultimate success of the whole is likely
to be endangered by a troublesome person, (generally a
naughty boy,) who will persist in crying out, "I know
how it is done!"&mdash;at the same time continually advancing
to the table, from which it is, of course, the business of the
conjurer to keep his youthful admirers. Should this be the
case, the magic whistles may be produced, and the remark
made, that now the troublesome boy shall show the company
a trick. Having taken up one of the whistles, which
has previously been filled with flour or magnesia, dust or
soot, proceed to give a few directions, particularly impressing
on him the necessity of blowing hard, because the
whistle you place in his hand is perforated with a number
of holes. The would-be magician is, therefore, excessively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
mortified, on applying his mouth and blowing hard, to receive
the powder in his face. Any turner will make such
a whistle, it being nothing more than the usual shaped toy
perforated at the top with a number of holes.</p>

<h3>THE SECRET OF VENTRILOQUISM.</h3>

<p>The main secret of this surprising art simply consists in
first making a strong, deep inspiration, by which a considerable
quantity of air is introduced into the lungs, to be
afterwards acted upon by the flexible powers of the larynx,
or cavity situated behind the tongue, and the trachea, or
windpipe; thus prepared, the expiration should be slow
and gradual. Any person, by practice, can, therefore, obtain
more or less expertness in this exercise; in which,
though not apparently, the voice is still modified by the
mouth and tongue; and it is in the concealment of this aid,
that much of the perfection of ventriloquism lies.</p>

<p>But the distinctive character of ventriloquism consists in
its imitations being performed by the voice <em>seeming</em> to come
from the stomach: hence its name, from <em>venter</em>, the stomach,
and <em>loquor</em>, to speak. Although the voice does not actually
come from that region, in order to enable the ventriloquist to
utter sounds from the larynx without moving the muscles of
his face, he strengthens them by a powerful action of the
abdominal muscles. Hence, he speaks by means of his
stomach; although the throat is the real source from whence
the sound proceeds. It should, however, be added, that
this speaking distinctly, without any movement of the lips
at all, is the highest perfection of ventriloquism, and has
but rarely been obtained. Thus, MM. St. Gille and Louis
Brabant, two celebrated French ventriloquists, appeared to
be absolutely mute while exercising their art, and no change
in their countenances could be discovered.</p>

<p>It has lately been shown, that some ventriloquists have
acquired by practice the power of exercising the veil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the palate in such a manner, that, by raising or depressing
it, they dilate or contract the inner nostrils. If they are
closely contracted, the sound produced is weak, dull, and
seems to be more or less distant; if, on the contrary, these
cavities are widely dilated, the sound will be strengthened,
the voice become loud, and apparently close to us.</p>

<p>Another of the secrets of ventriloquism, is the uncertainty
with respect to the direction of sounds. Thus, if we place
a man and a child in the same angle of uncertainty, and the
man speaks with the accent of a child, without any corresponding
motion in his mouth or face, we shall necessarily
believe that the voice comes from the child. In this case,
the belief is strengthened by the imagination; for if we
were directed to a statue, as the source from which we
were to expect sounds to issue, we should still be deceived,
and refer the sounds to the lifeless stone or marble. This
illusion will be greatly assisted by the voice being totally
different in tone and character from that of the man from
whom it really comes. Thus, we see how easy is the deception
when the sounds are required to proceed from any
given objects, and are such as they actually yield.</p>

<p>The ventriloquists of our time have carried their art still
further. They have not only spoken by the muscles of the
throat and the abdomen, without moving those of the face,
but have so far overcome the uncertainty of sound, as to
become acquainted with modifications of distance, obstruction,
and other causes, so as to imitate them with the greatest
accuracy. Thus, each of these artists has succeeded in carrying
on a dialogue; and each, in his own single person and
with his own single voice, has represented a scene apparently
with several actors. These ventriloquists have likewise possessed
such power over their faces and figures that, aided by
rapid changes of dress, their personal identity has scarcely
been recognized among the range of personations.</p>

<p>Vocal imitations are much less striking and ingenious
than the feats of ventriloquism. Extraordinary varieties of
voice may be produced, by speaking with a more acute or
grave pitch than usual, and by different contractions of the
mouth. Thus may be imitated the grinding of cutlery on a
wheel, the sawing of wood, the frying of a pancake, the
uncorking of a bottle, and the gurgling noise in emptying
its contents.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="560" height="466" alt="" />
</div>


<p>C<span class="smcapa">HEMISTRY</span> is one of the most attractive sciences. From
the beginning to the end, the student is surprised and delighted
with the developments of the exact discrimination,
as well as the power and capacity, which are displayed in
various forms of chemical action. Dissolve two substances
in the same fluid, and then by evaporation, or otherwise,
cause them to reassume a solid form, and each particle will
unite with its own kind, to the entire exclusion of all others.
Thus, if sulphate of copper and carbonate of soda are dissolved
in boiling water, and then the water is evaporated,
each salt will be re-formed as before. This phenomenon is
the result of one of the first principles of the science, and
as such is passed over without thought; but it is a wonderful
phenomenon, and made of no account only by the fact
that it is so common and so familiar.</p>

<p>It is by the action of this same principle, "chemical
affinity," that we produce the curious experiments with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
<span class="smcapa">SYMPATHETIC INKS</span>. By means of these, we may carry on a
correspondence which is beyond the discovery of all not in
the secret. With one class of these inks, the writing
becomes visible only when moistened with a particular
solution. Thus, if we write to you with a solution of sulphate
of iron, the letters are invisible. On the receipt of
our letter, you rub over the sheet a feather or sponge, wet
with a solution of nut-galls, and the letters burst forth into
sensible being at once, and are permanent.</p>

<p>2. If we write with a solution of sugar of lead, and you
moisten with a sponge or pencil dipped in water impregnated
with sulphuretted hydrogen, the letters will appear
with metallic brilliancy.</p>

<p>3. If we write with a weak solution of sulphate of copper,
and you apply ammonia, the letters assume a beautiful blue.
When the ammonia evaporates, as it does on exposure to
the sun or fire, the writing disappears, but may be revived
again as before.</p>

<p>4. If you write with oil of vitriol very much diluted, so
as to prevent its destroying the paper, the manuscript will
be invisible except when held to the fire, when the letters
will appear black.</p>

<p>5. Write with cobalt dissolved in diluted muriatic acid;
the letters will be invisible when cold, but when warmed
they will appear a bluish green.</p>

<p>We are almost sure that our secrets thus written will not
be brought to the knowledge of a stranger, because he
does not know the solution which was used in writing, and
therefore knows not what to apply to bring out the letters.</p>

<p>Other forms of elective affinity produce equally novel
results. Thus, two invisible gases, when combined, form
sometimes a <em>visible solid</em>. Muriatic acid and ammonia are
examples, also ammonia and carbonic acid.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a solution of sulphate of soda be
mixed with a solution of muriate of lime, the whole becomes
solid.</p>

<p>Some gases when united form liquids, as oxygen and
hydrogen, which unite and form water. Some solids, when
combined, form liquids.</p>

<p>Chemical affinity is sometimes called <em>elective</em>, or the effect
of <em>choice</em>, as if one substance exerted a kind of <em>preference</em> for
another, and chose to be united to it rather than to that
with which it was previously combined; thus, if you pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
some vinegar, which is a weak acetic acid, upon some
pearlash, (a combination of potassa and carbonic acid,) or
some carbonate of soda, (a combination of the same acid
with soda,) a violent effervescence will take place, occasioned
by the escape of the carbonic acid, displaced in consequence
of the potash or soda preferring the acetic acid, and forming
a compound called an acetate. Then, if some sulphuric
acid be poured on this new compound, the acetic acid will
in its turn be displaced by the greater attachment of either
of the bases, as they are termed, for the sulphuric acid.
Again, if into a solution of blue vitriol, (a combination of
sulphuric acid with oxide of copper,) the bright blade of a
knife be introduced, the knife will speedily be covered with
a coat of copper, deposited in consequence of the acid <em>preferring</em>
the iron of which the knife is made, a quantity of it
being dissolved in exact proportion to the quantity of copper
deposited.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 174px;">
<img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="174" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is on the same principle that a very beautiful preparation,
called a silver-tree, or a lead-tree, may be formed,
thus: Fill a wide bottle, capable of holding from half a
pint to a pint, with a tolerably strong solution of nitrate of
silver, (lunar caustic,) or acetate of lead, in pure distilled
water; then attach a small piece of zinc by a string to the
cork or stopper of the bottle, so that the zinc shall hang
about the middle of the bottle, and set it by where it may
be quite undisturbed; in a short time, brilliant plates of
silver or lead, as the case may be, will be
seen to collect around the piece of zinc,
assuming more or less of the crystalline
form. This is a case of elective affinity;
the acid with which the silver or lead was
united <em>prefers</em> the zinc to either of those
metals, and in consequence discards them
in order to attach the zinc to itself; and
this process will continue until the whole
of the zinc is taken up, or the whole of the
silver or lead deposited.</p>

<p>Again, many animal and vegetable substances consist
for the most part of carbon or charcoal, united with oxygen
and hydrogen in the proportion which forms water. Now
oil of vitriol (strong sulphuric acid) has so powerful an
affinity, or so great a <em>thirst</em> for water, that it will abstract it
from almost any body in which it exists; if you then pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
some of this acid on a lump of sugar, or place a chip of
wood in it, the sugar or wood will speedily become quite
black, or be <em>charred</em>, as it is called, in consequence of the
oxygen and hydrogen being removed by the sulphuric acid,
and only the carbon, or charcoal, left.</p>

<p>When Cleopatra dissolved pearls of wondrous value in
vinegar, she was exhibiting unwittingly an instance of
chemical elective affinity; the pearl being simply carbonate
of lime, which was decomposed by the greater affinity or
fondness of lime for its new acquaintance, (the acetic acid
of the vinegar,) than for the carbonic acid, with which it
had been united all its life; an example of inconstancy in
strong contrast with the conduct of its owner, who chose
death rather than become the mistress of her lover's
conqueror.</p>


<p class="p6">EXPERIMENTS ON COMBUSTION.</p>

<p>Into an ordinary wine bottle put some pieces of granulated
zinc, and pour on them a mixture of sulphuric acid and
water, in the proportion of about one part of acid to four
of water, then close the bottle with a cork having a hole
bored through the middle, in which a piece of glass tube is
inserted; wait some minutes that the atmospheric air in the
bottle may be expelled by the hydrogen gas set free by the
decomposition of the water, then apply a lighted taper to
the end of the tube, when the gas will inflame, giving out
so little light as to be barely visible by daylight, but producing
so intense a heat that a piece of platinum wire
instantly becomes white hot when held in the flame. If
you hold a glass tumbler inverted over the flame, it becomes
covered with minute drops of water, the result of the union
of the hydrogen with the oxygen of the air, and in this case
water is the only product.</p>

<p>If a piece of charcoal, which is pure carbon or nearly so,
be ignited, and introduced into a jar, containing oxygen or
common atmospheric air, the product will be carbonic acid
gas only. As most combustible bodies contain both carbon
and hydrogen, the result of their combination is carbonic
acid and water. This is the case with the gas used for illumination;
and in order to prevent the water so produced
from spoiling goods in shops, various plans have been
devised for carrying off the water when in the state of
steam. This is generally accomplished by suspending over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the burners glass bells, communicating with tubes opening
into the chimney, or passing outside the house.</p>

<p>To show that oxygen, or some equivalent, is necessary
for the support of combustion, fix two or three pieces of
wax taper on flat pieces of cork, and set them floating on
water in a soup-plate, light them, and invert over them a
glass jar; as they burn, the heat produced may perhaps
at first expand the air so as to force a small quantity out of
the jar, but the water will soon rise in the jar, and continue
to do so until the tapers expire, when you will find that a
considerable portion of the air has disappeared, and what
remains will no longer support flame; that is, the oxygen
has been converted partly into water, and partly into carbonic
acid gas, by uniting with the carbon and hydrogen
of which the taper consists, and the remaining air is principally
nitrogen, with some carbonic acid: the presence of
the latter may be proved by decanting some of the remaining
air into a bottle, and then shaking some lime-water with
it, which will absorb the carbonic acid and form chalk.</p>

<p>Into an ale-glass, two thirds full of water at about 140°,
drop one or two pieces of phosphorus about the size of peas,
and they will remain unaltered. Then take a bladder containing
oxygen gas, to which is attached a stop-cock and a
long fine tube; pass the end of the tube to the bottom of
the water, turn the stop-cock, and press the bladder gently;
as the gas reaches the phosphorus it will take fire, and burn
under the water with a brilliant flame, filling the glass with
brilliant flashes of light dashing through the water.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 176px;">
<img src="images/i_087.jpg" width="176" height="210" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Into another glass put some cold water; introduce carefully
some of the salt called chlorate
of potassa, upon that drop a piece of
phosphorus; then let some strong
sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) trickle
slowly down the side of the glass, or
introduce it by means of a dropping
bottle. As soon as it touches the salt
it decomposes it, and liberates a gas
which ignites the phosphorus, producing
much the same appearance as in the last experiment.</p>

<p>Into the half of a broken phial put some chlorate of potassa,
and pour in some oil of vitriol. The phial will soon
be filled with a heavy gas of a deep yellow color. Tie a
small test tube at right angles to the end of a stick not less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
than a yard long, put a little ether into the tube, and pour
it gently into the phial of gas, when an instantaneous explosion
will take place, and the ether will be set on fire.
This experiment should be performed in a place where there
are no articles of furniture to be damaged, as the ingredients
are often scattered by the explosion, and the oil of vitriol
destroys all animal and vegetable substances.</p>

<p>Into a jar containing oxygen gas, introduce a coil of soft
iron wire, suspended to a cork that fits the neck of the jar,
and having attached a small piece of charcoal to the lower
part of the wire, ignite the charcoal. The iron will take fire
and burn with a brilliant light, throwing out bright scintillations,
which are oxide of iron, formed by the union of the
gas with the iron; and they are so intensely hot, that some
of them will probably <em>melt</em> their way into the sides of the
jar, if not through them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="150" height="252" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But by far the most intense heat, and most brilliant light,
may be produced by introducing a piece of phosphorus into
a jar of oxygen. The phosphorus may be placed in a small
copper cup, with a long handle of thick wire
passing through a hole in a cork that fits the
jar. The phosphorus must first be ignited; and
as soon as it is introduced into the oxygen, it
gives out a light so brilliant that no eye can
bear it, and the whole jar appears filled with
an intensely luminous atmosphere. It is well
to dilute the oxygen with about one fourth
part of common air, to moderate the intense
heat, which is nearly certain to break the jar,
if pure oxygen is used.</p>

<p>The following experiment shows the production of heat
by chemical action alone. Bruise some fresh prepared
crystals of nitrate of copper, spread them over a piece of
tin foil, sprinkle them with a little water; then fold up the
foil tightly, as rapidly as possible, and in a minute or two
it will become red hot, the tin apparently burning away.
This heat is produced by the energetic action of the tin on
the nitrate of copper, taking away its oxygen in order to
unite with the nitric acid, for which, as well as for the oxygen,
the tin has a much greater affinity than the copper has.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 143px;">
<img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="143" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Combustion without flame may be shown in a very elegant
and agreeable manner, by making a coil of platinum wire
by twisting it round the stem of a tobacco pipe, or any
cylindrical body, for a dozen times or so, leaving about an
inch straight, which should be inserted into the wick of a
spirit lamp; light the lamp, and after it has burned for a
minute or two, extinguish the flame quickly; the wire will
soon become red hot, and, if kept from draughts of air, will
continue to burn until all the spirit is consumed.
Spongy platinum, as it is called,
answers rather better than wire, and has
been employed in the formation of fumigators
for the drawing-room, in which, instead of
pure spirit, some perfume, such as lavender
water, is used; by its combustion an agreeable
odor is diffused through the apartment. These little
lamps were much in vogue a few years ago, but are now
nearly out of fashion.</p>

<p>Experiments on combustion might be multiplied, almost to
any amount, but the above will be sufficient for our purpose.</p>


<p class="p6">POTASSIUM.</p>

<p>Potassium was discovered by Sir H. Davy, in the beginning
of the present century, while acting upon potash with
the enormous galvanic battery of the Royal Institution, consisting
of two thousand pairs of four inch plates. It is a
brilliant white metal, so soft as to be easily cut with a penknife,
and so light as to swim upon water, on which it acts
with great energy, uniting with the oxygen, and liberating
the hydrogen, which takes fire as it escapes.</p>


<p class="p6a">EXPERIMENT.</p>

<p>Trace some continuous lines on paper with a camel's-hair
brush, dipped in water, and place a piece of potassium
about the size of a pea, on one of the lines, and it will follow
the course of the pencil, taking fire as it runs, and
burning with a purplish light. The paper will be found
covered with a solution of ordinary potash. If turmeric
paper be used, the course of the potassium will be marked
with a deep brown color. Corollary: hence, if you touch
potassium with <em>wet</em> fingers, you will burn them!</p>

<p>If a small piece of the metal be placed on a piece of ice,
it will instantly take fire, and form a deep hole, which will
be found to contain a solution of potash.</p>

<p>In consequence of its great affinity for oxygen, potassium
must be kept in some fluid destitute of it, such as naphtha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Saltpeter, or niter, is a compound of this metal (or rather
its oxide) with nitric acid. It is one of the ingredients of
gunpowder, and has the property of quickening the combustion
of all combustible bodies.</p>


<p class="p6a">EXPERIMENT.</p>

<p>Rub together in a <em>warm</em> mortar, three parts of powdered
niter, two of dry carbonate of potash, and one of flour of
brimstone; place a small quantity of the mixture in an iron
ladle, and heat it over the fire, when it will speedily melt,
and then explode with a very loud noise; and if held under
a foul chimney, will save the expense of a chimney sweep:
but avoid cooking time.</p>

<p>Another salt of potash remarkable for the same property,
in even a greater degree, is the <em>chlorate</em> of potash.</p>


<p class="p6a">EXPERIMENTS.</p>

<p>1. Triturate together in a <em>dry</em> mortar a few grains of flowers
of sulphur, with a small quantity of the chlorate of potash,
and a succession of sharp explosions, like the crack of a
whip, will be produced.</p>

<p>2. Substitute half a grain of phosphorus for the sulphur,
and the action will be much more violent. The hand should
be defended by a thick glove, and the eyes carefully guarded,
in making this experiment.</p>

<p>3. Mix very carefully a little of this salt, reduced to
powder, with a little lump sugar, also powdered, and drop
on the mixture a little strong sulphuric acid, and it will instantly
burst into a flame. This experiment also requires
caution.</p>

<p>Want of space precludes us from considering the individual
metals and their compounds in detail; it must suffice to
describe some experiments, showing some of their properties.</p>

<p>The different affinities of the metals for oxygen, may be
exhibited in various ways. The silver or zinc tree has
already been described.</p>


<p class="p6a">EXPERIMENTS.</p>

<p>1. Into a solution of nitrate of silver, in distilled water,
immerse a clean plate or slip of copper. The solution, which
was colorless, will soon begin to assume a greenish tint, and
the piece of copper will be covered with a coating of a light
gray color, which is the silver formerly united to the nitric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
acid, which has been displaced by the greater affinity or
<em>liking</em> of the oxygen and acid for the copper.</p>

<p>2. When the copper is no longer coated, but remains clean
and bright when immersed in the fluid, all the silver has been
deposited, and the glass now contains a solution of <em>copper</em>.</p>

<p>Place a piece of clean iron in the solution, and it will
almost instantly be coated with a film of <em>copper</em>, and this will
continue until the whole of that metal is removed, and its
place filled by an equivalent quantity of <em>iron</em>, so that nitrate
of <em>iron</em> is found in the liquid. The oxygen and nitric acid
remain unaltered in quantity or quality during these changes,
being merely transferred from one metal to another.</p>

<p>A piece of zinc will displace the iron in like manner, leaving
a solution of nitrate of zinc.</p>

<p>Nearly all the colors used in the arts, are produced by
metals and their combinations; indeed, one is named
<em>chromium</em>, from a Greek word signifying color, on account
of the beautiful tints obtained from its various combinations
with oxygen and the other metals. All the various tints of
green, orange, yellow, and red, are obtained from this
metal.</p>

<p>Solutions of most of the metallic salts give precipitates
with solutions of alkalies and their salts, as well as with
many other substances, such as what are usually called
prussiate of potash, hydro-sulphuret of ammonia, &amp;c.; and
the colors differ according to the metal employed; and so
small a quantity is required to produce the color, that the
solutions before mixing may be nearly colorless.</p>


<p class="p6a">EXPERIMENTS.</p>

<p>1. To a solution of sulphate of iron, add a drop or two of
a solution of prussiate of potash, and a blue color will be
produced.</p>

<p>2. Substitute sulphate of copper for iron, and the color
will be a rich brown.</p>

<p>3. Another blue, of quite a different tint, may be produced
by letting a few drops of a solution of ammonia fall into one
of sulphate of copper, when a precipitate of a light blue falls
down, which is dissolved by an additional quantity of the
ammonia, and forms a transparent solution of the most
splendid rich blue color.</p>

<p>4. Into a solution of sulphate of iron, drop a few drops of
a strong infusion of galls, and the color will become a bluish-black&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
fact, <em>ink</em>. A little <em>tea</em> will answer as well as the
infusion of galls. This is the reason why certain stuffs
formerly in general use for dressing gowns for gentlemen
were so objectionable; for as they were indebted to a salt
of iron for their color, buff, as it was called, a drop of tea
accidentally spilled, produced all the effect of a drop of ink.</p>

<p>5. Put into a largish test tube, two or three small pieces
of granulated zinc, fill it about one third full of water, put
in a few grains of iodine, and boil the water, which will at
first acquire a dark purple color, gradually fading as the
iodine combines with the zinc. Add a little more iodine
from time to time, until the zinc is nearly all dissolved. If
a few drops of this solution be added to an equally colorless
solution of corrosive sublimate (a salt of mercury), a precipitate
will take place of a splendid scarlet color, brighter,
if possible, than vermilion, which is also a preparation of
mercury.</p>


<p class="p6">CRYSTALLIZATION OF METALS.</p>

<p>Some of the metals assume certain definite forms in return
from the fluid to the solid state. Bismuth shows this
property more readily than most others.</p>


<p class="p6a">EXPERIMENT.</p>

<p>Melt a pound or two of bismuth in an iron ladle over the
fire; remove it as soon as the whole is fluid; and when the
surface has become solid break a hole in it, and pour out
the still fluid metal from the interior; what remains will exhibit
beautifully-formed crystals of a cubic shape.</p>

<p>Sulphur may be crystallized in the same manner, but its
fumes, when heated, are so very unpleasant, that few would
wish to encounter them.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable facts in chemistry&mdash;a science
abounding in wonders&mdash;is the circumstance that the mere
contact of hydrogen, the <em>lightest</em> body known, with the metal
platinum, the heaviest, when in a state of minute division,
called spongy platinum, produces an intense heat, sufficient
to inflame the hydrogen: of course this experiment must be
made in the presence of atmospheric air or oxygen. If a
small piece of the metal in the state above named be introduced
into a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, it will cause
them to explode. A very small quantity of gas should be
employed, and placed in a jar lightly covered with a card,
or the explosion would be dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">BEAUTIES OF CRYSTALLIZATION.</p>

<p>Dissolve alum in hot water until no more can be dissolved
in it; place in it a smooth glass rod and a stick of the same
size; next day, the stick will be found covered with crystals,
but the glass rod will be free from them: in this case,
the crystals cling to the rough surface of the stick, but have
no hold upon the smooth surface of the glass rod. But if
the rod be roughened with a file at certain intervals, and
then placed in the alum and water, the crystals will adhere
to the rough surfaces, and leave <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'the'">them</ins> smooth bright
and clear.</p>

<p>Tie some threads of lamp-cotton irregularly around a copper
wire or glass rod; place it in a hot solution of blue vitriol,
strong as above, and the threads will be covered with
beautiful blue crystals, while the glass rod will be bare.</p>

<p>Bore a hole through a piece of coke, and suspend it by a
string from a stick, placed across a hot solution of alum; it
will float; but, as it becomes loaded with crystals, it will
sink in the solution according to the length of the string.
Gas-coke has mostly a smooth, shining, and almost metallic
surface, which the crystals will avoid, while they will cling
only to the most irregular and porous parts.</p>

<p>If powdered turmeric be added to the hot solution of
alum, the crystals will be of a bright yellow; litmus will
cause them to be of a bright red; logwood will yield purple;
and common writing ink, black; and the more muddy
the solution, the finer will be the crystals.</p>

<p>To keep colored alum crystals from breaking or losing
their color, place them under a glass shade with a saucer
of water; this will preserve the atmosphere moist, and prevent
the crystals getting too dry.</p>

<p>If crystals be formed on wire, they will be liable to break
off, from the expansion and contraction of the wire by
changes of temperature.</p>


<p class="p6">TO CRYSTALLIZE CAMPHOR.</p>

<p>Dissolve camphor in spirit of wine, moderately heated,
until the spirit will not dissolve any more; pour some of the
solution into a cold glass, and the camphor will instantly
crystallize in beautiful tree-like forms, such as we see in the
show-glasses of camphor in druggists' windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">CRYSTALLIZED TIN.</p>

<p>Mix half an ounce of nitric acid, six drams of muriatic
acid, and two ounces of water; pour the mixture upon a
piece of tin plate previously made hot, and after washing it
in the mixture it will bear a beautiful crystalline surface, in
feathery forms. This is the celebrated <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">moirée métallique</em>, and,
when varnished, is made into ornamental boxes, &amp;c. The
figures will vary according to the degree of heat previously
given to the metal.</p>


<p class="p6">CRYSTALS IN HARD WATER.</p>

<p>Hold in a wine-glass of hard water a crystal of oxalic
acid, and white threads, <em>i. e.</em> oxalate of lime, will instantly
descend through the liquid suspended from the crystal.</p>


<p class="p6">VARIETIES OF CRYSTALS.</p>

<p>Make distinct solutions of common salt, niter, and alum;
set them in three saucers in any warm place, and let part
of the water dry away or evaporate; then remove them to
a warm room. The particles of the salts in each <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sacer'">saucer</ins> will
begin to attract each other, and form crystals, but not all
of the same figure: the common salt will yield crystals
with six square and equal faces, or sides; the niter six-sided
crystals; and the alum, eight-sided crystals; and if these
crystals be dissolved over and over again, they will always
appear in the same forms.</p>


<p class="p6">A LIQUID CHANGED TO A SOLID, AND HEAT FROM CRYSTALLIZATION.</p>

<p>A strong saline solution excluded from the <em>air</em> will frequently
crystallize the instant that air is admitted. For
this purpose make a solution of Glauber's salt (sulphate
of soda) in boiling water (3 lbs. of the salt to 2 lbs. of
water); bottle and cork quickly; also tie over the neck a
piece of wet bladder. When perfectly cold, or even a few
days afterwards, remove the cork, and the salt will immediately
crystallize, shooting out the most beautiful crystals,
at last becoming nearly solid: at the same time the whole
becomes warm, in consequence of the latent heat generated
by the change of the liquid to the solid state. If the liquid
will not crystallize quickly on removing the cork, tie a crystal
of Glauber's salt to a bit of wire, touch the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the liquid, and the crystallization will then generally
occur.</p>


<p class="p6a">ANOTHER EXPERIMENT.</p>

<p>Heat some blue vitriol (sulphate of copper) in an
iron ladle till all the water contained in the crystals
is driven off, and the color changes to a gray.
Take the lumps out without breaking them, and lay the
dried blue vitriol on a plate; if this be moistened with
water, steam is produced; and if a slice of phosphorus is
then laid on the sulphate of copper, it ignites, demonstrating
again that the condensation of a liquid produces heat.
The addition of the water restores the blue color, thus proving
that water was necessary to the composition of blue
vitriol.</p>


<p class="p6">A SOLID CHANGED TO A LIQUID, AND INTENSE COLD FROM THE LIQUEFACTION.</p>

<p>Mix five parts by weight of powdered muriate of ammonia,
commonly termed sal ammoniac, five parts of niter in powder,
and sixteen parts of water. A temperature of twenty-two
degrees below the freezing point of water is produced; and
if a phial of water, or any convenient metallic cylinder containing
water, be surrounded with a sufficient quantity of
the freezing mixture, ice is obtained. The ice clings to the
interior of the tube, but may easily be removed by dipping
it in tepid water.</p>

<p>This experiment is the reverse of the last, and proves
that a sudden reduction of a solid to the liquid condition
always affords cold.</p>

<p>An amusing combination of two experiments may be
made by putting some fresh-burned lime into one tea-pot
and this freezing mixture into another. When water is
poured on the one containing lime, it gives out steam from
the spout; while the addition of water to the other produces
so much cold, that it can hardly be kept in the hand. Thus
heat and cold are afforded by the same medium, water.</p>


<p class="p6">MAGIC OF HEAT.</p>

<p>Melt a small quantity of the sulphate of potassa and copper
in a spoon over a spirit lamp; it will be fused at a heat
just below redness, and produce a liquid of a dark green
color. Remove the spoon from the flame, when the liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
will become a solid of a brilliant emerald green color, and
so remain till its heat sinks nearly to that of boiling water;
when suddenly a commotion will take place throughout the
mass, beginning from the surface, and each atom, as if animated,
will start up and separate itself from the rest, till,
in a few moments, the whole will become a heap of powder.</p>


<p class="p6">SUBLIMATION BY HEAT.</p>

<p>Provide two small pieces of glass; sprinkle a minute portion
of sulphur upon one piece, lay thin slips of wood
around it, and place upon it the other piece of glass.
Move them slowly over the flame of a lamp or candle, and
the sulphur will become sublimed, and form gray nebulous
patches, which are very curious microscopic objects. Each
cluster consists of thousands of transparent globules, imitating
in miniature the nebulæ which we see figured in
treatises on astronomy. By observing the largest particles,
we shall find them to be flattened on one side. Being very
transparent, each of them acts the part of a little lens, and
forms in its focus the image of a distant light, which can
be perceived even in the smaller globules, until it vanishes
from minuteness. If they are examined again after a certain
number of hours, the smaller globules will generally
be found to have retained their transparency, while the
larger ones will have become opaque, in consequence of
the sulphur having undergone some internal spontaneous
change. But the most remarkable circumstance attending
this experiment is, that the globules are found adhering to
the upper glass only; the reason of which is, that the
upper glass is somewhat cooler than the lower one: by
which means we see that the vapor of sulphur is very powerfully
repelled by heated glass. The flattened form of the
particles is owing to the force with which they endeavor to
recede from the lower glass, and their consequent pressure
against the surface of the upper one. This experiment is
considered by its originator, Mr. H. F. Talbot, F.R.S., England,
to be a satisfactory argument in favor of the repulsive power
of heat.</p>


<p class="p6">HEAT PASSING THROUGH GLASS.</p>

<p>The following experiment is also by Mr. Talbot: Heat a
poker bright red hot, and having opened a window, apply
the poker quickly very near to the outside of a pane, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the hand to the inside; a strong heat will be felt at the
instant, which will cease as soon as the poker is withdrawn,
and may be again renewed, and made to cease as quickly
as before. Now, it is well known that if a piece of glass
be so much warmed as to convey the impression of heat to
the hand, it will retain some part of that heat for a minute
or more; but in this experiment the heat will vanish in a
moment. It will not, therefore, be the heated pane of glass
that we shall feel, but heat which has come through the
glass, in a free or radiant state.</p>


<p class="p6">METALS UNEQUALLY INFLUENCED BY HEAT.</p>

<p>All metals do not conduct heat at the same rate, as may
be proved by holding in the flame of a candle at the same
time, a piece of silver wire and a piece of platina wire,
when the silver wire will become too hot to hold, much
sooner than the platina. Or, cut a cone of each wire, tip
it with wax, and place it upon a heated plate, (as a fire-shovel,)
when the wax will melt at different periods.</p>


<p class="p6">SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION.</p>

<p>Mix a small quantity of chlorate of potassa with spirit of
wine in a strong saucer; add a little sulphuric acid, and
an orange vapor will arise and burst into flame with a loud
crackling sound.</p>


<p class="p6">INEQUALITY OF HEAT IN FIRE-IRONS.</p>

<p>Place before a brisk fire a set of polished fire-irons, and
beside them a rough unpolished poker, such as is used in a
kitchen, instead of a bright poker. The polished irons
will remain for a long time without becoming warmer than
the temperature of the room, because the heat radiated from
the fire is all reflected, or thrown off, by the polished surface
of the irons, and none of it is absorbed. The rough
poker will, however, become speedily hot, so as not to be
used without inconvenience. Hence, the polish of fire-irons
is not merely ornamental, but useful.</p>


<p class="p6">EXPANSION OF METAL BY HEAT.</p>

<p>Provide an iron rod, and fit it exactly into a metal ring:
heat the rod red hot, and it will no longer enter the ring.</p>

<p>Observe an iron gate on a warm day, when it will shut
with difficulty; whereas it will shut loosely and easily on
a cold day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">EVAPORATION OF A METAL.</p>

<p>Rub a globule of mercury upon a silver spoon, and the
two metals will combine with a white appearance; heat the
spoon carefully in the flame of a spirit lamp, when the mercury
will volatilize and disappear, and the spoon may then
be polished until it recovers its usual luster: if, however,
the mercury be left for some time on the spoon, the solid
texture of the silver will be destroyed throughout, and then
the silver can only be recovered by heating it in a ladle.
Care must be taken to avoid the fumes of mercury, which
are very poisonous.</p>


<p class="p6">A FLOATING METAL ON FIRE.</p>

<p>Throw a small piece of that marvelous substance, potassium,
into a basin of water, and it will swim upon the surface
and burn with a beautiful light, of a red color mixed with
violet. When moderately heated in the air, potassium takes
fire, and burns with a red light.</p>


<p class="p6">ICE MELTED BY AIR.</p>

<p>If two pieces of ice be placed in a warm room, one of
them may be made to melt much sooner than the other, by
blowing on it with a pair of bellows.</p>


<p class="p6">SPLENDID SUBLIMATION.</p>

<p>Put into a flask a small portion of iodine; hold the flask
over the flame of a spirit-lamp, and from the state of bluish-black
crystals, the iodine, on being heated, will become a
violet-colored transparent gas; but, in cooling, will resume
its crystalline form.</p>


<p class="p6">MAGIC INKS.</p>

<p>Dissolve oxide of cobalt in acetic acid, to which add a
little niter: write with this solution; hold the writing to
the fire, and it will be of pale rose color, which will disappear
on cooling.</p>

<p>Dissolve equal parts of sulphate of copper and muriate
of ammonia in water; write with the solution, and it will
give a yellow color when heated, which will disappear
when cold.</p>

<p>Dissolve nitrate of bismuth in water; write with the solution,
and the characters will be invisible when dry, but
will become legible on immersion in water.</p>

<p>Dissolve, in water, muriate of cobalt, which is of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
bluish-green colour, and the solution will be pink; write
with it, and the characters will be scarcely visible: but, if
gently heated, they will appear in brilliant green, which
will disappear as the paper cools.</p>

<p>Dissolve in water a few grains of prussiate of potash;
write with this liquid, which is invisible when dry; wash
over with a dilute solution of iron, made by dissolving a
nail in a little aqua fortis; a blue and legible writing is
immediately apparent.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>


<p class="p6">CHAMELEON LIQUIDS.</p>

<p>Put a small portion of the compound called mineral
chameleon into several glasses, pour upon each water at
different temperatures, and the contents of each glass will
exhibit a different shade of color. A very hot solution
will be of a beautiful green color; a cold one, a deep purple.</p>

<p>Make a colorless solution of sulphate of copper; add to
it a little ammonia, equally colorless, and the mixture will
be of an intense blue color; add to it a little sulphuric
acid, and the blue color will disappear; pour in a little solution
of caustic ammonia, and the blue color will be restored.
Thus may the liquor be changed at pleasure.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MAGIC DYES.</p>

<p>Dissolve indigo in diluted sulphuric acid, and add to it
an equal quantity of solution of carbonate of potassa. If
a piece of white cloth be dipped in the mixture, it will be
changed to blue; yellow cloth, in the same mixture, may
be changed to green; red to purple; and blue litmus paper
to red.</p>

<p>Nearly fill a wine-glass with the juice of beet-root, which
is of a deep red color; add a little lime-water, and the
mixture will be colorless; dip into it a piece of white cloth,
dry it rapidly, and in a few hours the cloth will become red.</p>


<p class="p6">WINE CHANGED INTO WATER.</p>

<p>Mix a little solution of subacetate of lead with port wine;
filter the mixture through blotting-paper, and a colorless
liquid will pass through; to this add a small quantity of
dry salt of tartar; distil in a retort, when a spirit will arise,
which may be inflamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="p6">TWO COLORLESS TRANSPARENT LIQUIDS BECOME BLACK AND OPAQUE.</p>

<p>Have in one vessel some dilute hydrosulphate of ammonia,
and in another a solution of acetate of lead; they are both
colorless and transparent; mix them, and they will become
black and opaque.</p>


<p class="p6">TWO COLORLESS FLUIDS MAKE A COLORED ONE.</p>

<p>Put into a wine-glass of water a few drops of prussiate
of potash, and into a second glass of water a little weak
solution of sulphate of iron in water; pour the colorless
mixtures together into a tumbler, and they will be immediately
changed to a bright deep blue.</p>

<p>Or, mix the solution of prussiate of potash with that of
nitrate of bismuth, and a yellow will be the product.</p>

<p>Or, mix the solution of prussiate of potash with that of
sulphate of copper, and the mixture will be of a reddish-brown
color.</p>


<p class="p6">CHANGE OF COLOR BY COLORLESS FLUIDS.</p>

<p>Three different colors may be produced from the same infusion,
merely by the addition of three colorless fluids.
Slice a little red cabbage, pour boiling water upon it, and
when cold decant the clear infusion, which divide into
three wine-glasses: to one, add a small quantity of solution
of alum in water; to the second, a little solution of potash
in water; and to the third, a few drops of muriatic acid.
The liquor in the first glass will assume a purple color, the
second a bright green, and the third a rich crimson.</p>


<p class="p6">TO CHANGE A BLUE LIQUID TO WHITE.</p>

<p>Dissolve a small lump of indigo in sulphuric acid by the
aid of moderate heat, and you will obtain an intense blue
color; add a drop of this to half a pint of water, so as to
dilute the blue; then pour some of it into strong chloride
of lime, and the blue will be bleached with almost magical
velocity.</p>


<p class="p6">VERITABLE "BLACK" TEA.</p>

<p>Make a cup of strong green tea; dissolve a little green
copperas in water, which add to the tea, and its color will
be black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">RESTORATION OF COLOR BY WATER.</p>

<p>Water being a colorless fluid, ought, one would imagine,
when mixed with other substances of no decided color,
to produce a colorless compound. Nevertheless, it is to
water only that blue vitriol, or sulphate of copper, owes its
vivid blueness, as will be plainly evinced by the following
simple experiment. Heat a few crystals of the vitriol in a
fire-shovel, pulverize them, and the powder will be of a dull
and dirty white <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'appearence'">appearance</ins>. Pour a little water upon this,
when a slight hissing noise will be heard, and at the same
moment the blue color will instantly reappear.</p>

<p>Under the microscope the beauty of this experiment will
be increased, for the instant that a drop of water is placed
in contact with the vitriol, the powder may be seen to shoot
into blue prisms. If a crystal of prussiate of potash be
similarly heated, its yellow color will vanish, but reappear
on being dropped into water.</p>

<p class="p6"><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>TWO LIQUIDS MAKE A SOLID.</p>

<p>Dissolve muriate of lime in water until it will dissolve
no more; measure out an equal quantity of oil of vitriol;
both will be transparent fluids; but if equal quantities of
each be slowly mixed and stirred together, they will become
a solid mass, with the evolution of smoke or fumes of
muriatic acid.</p>


<p class="p6">TWO SOLIDS MAKE A LIQUID.</p>

<p>Rub together in a mortar, equal quantities of the crystals
of Glauber salts and nitrate of ammonia, and the two salts
will slowly become a liquid.</p>


<p class="p6">A SOLID OPAQUE MASS MAKES A TRANSPARENT LIQUID.</p>

<p>Take the solid mixture of the solutions of muriate of lime
and carbonate of potash, pour upon it a very little nitric
acid, and the solid opaque mass will be changed to a transparent
liquid.</p>


<p class="p6">TWO COLD LIQUIDS MAKE A HOT ONE.</p>

<p>Mix four drams of sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) with one
dram of cold water, suddenly, in a cup, and the mixture
will be nearly half as hot again as boiling water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p class="p6">QUINTUPLE TRANSMUTATION.</p>

<p>Take five ale-glasses: place into the first a solution of
iodide of potassium; into the second, a solution of corrosive
sublimate, sufficiently strong to yield a scarlet precipitate
with the iodide in the first glass, without redissolving, as
the effect of the experiment depends on the adjustment of
this beforehand; into the third, a strong solution of iodide
of potassium with some oxalate of ammonia; into the fourth,
a solution of muriate of lime; into the fifth, a solution of
hydrosulphate of ammonia. The following changes occur.</p>

<p>No. 1 added to No. 2 produces a yellow, quickly changing
to a scarlet; No. 2, poured into No. 3, becomes clear and
transparent again; No. 3, into No. 4, changes a milky
white; No. 4, poured into No. 5, produces a black precipitate.</p>

<p>Thus, a clear and colorless liquid is changed to scarlet;
the scarlet again becomes colorless; the colorless liquid,
milky white; and the white, black.</p>


<p class="p6">THE SAME AGENT MAY PRODUCE AND DESTROY COLOR.</p>

<p>Procure a bottle of chlorine, and arrange two tall cylindrical
glasses: fill one half full with a dilute solution of
iodide of potassium and starch, and the other with a very
dilute solution of sulphate of indigo; provide each vessel
with a plate glass or cardboard valve, laid on the top; carefully
open the bottle of chlorine, invert it slowly over one
cylindrical vessel, so as to pour out half the gas, which is
very heavy; add the remainder to the other, and shake up
both vessels. The chlorine will bleach the indigo, and
afford a magnificent purple in the iodide of potassium and
starch, because it sets free iodine, which combines with the
starch, producing a purple compound.</p>


<p class="p6">UNION OF TWO METALS WITHOUT HEAT.</p>

<p>Cut a circular piece of gold leaf, called "dentists' gold,"
about half an inch in diameter; drop upon it a globule of
mercury, about the size of a small pea, and if they be left
for a short time, the gold will lose its solidity and yellow
color, and the mercury its liquid form, making a soft mass
of the color of mercury.</p>


<p class="p6">MAGIC BREATH.</p>

<p>Half fill a glass tumbler with lime-water; breathe into
it frequently, at the same time stirring it with a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
glass. The fluid, which before was perfectly transparent,
will presently become quite white, and if allowed to remain
at rest, real chalk will be deposited.</p>


<p class="p6">TWO BITTERS MAKE A SWEET.</p>

<p>It has been discovered, that a mixture of nitrate of silver
with hyposulphate of soda, both of which are remarkably
bitter, will produce the sweetest known substance.</p>


<p class="p6">VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE.</p>

<p>Write with French chalk on a looking-glass; wipe it with
a handkerchief, and the lines <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'will will'">will</ins> disappear; breathe
on it, and they will reappear. This alternation will take
place for a great number of times, and after the lapse of a
considerable period.</p>


<p class="p6">TO FORM A LIQUID FROM TWO SOLIDS.</p>

<p>Rub together in a Wedgewood mortar a small quantity
of sulphate of soda and acetate of lead, and as they mix they
will become liquid.</p>

<p>Carbonate of ammonia and sulphate of copper, previously
reduced to powder separately, will also, when mixed, become
liquid, and acquire a most splendid blue color.</p>

<p>The greater number of salts have a tendency to assume
regular forms, or become <em>crystallized</em>, when passing from the
fluid to the solid state; and the size and regularity of the
crystals depends in a great measure on the slow or rapid
escape of the fluid in which they were dissolved. Sugar is
a capital example of this property; the ordinary loaf-sugar
being rapidly boiled down, as it is called: while to make
rock-candy, which is nothing but sugar in a crystallized
form, the solution is allowed to evaporate slowly, and as it
cools it forms into those beautiful crystals termed rock-candy.
The threads found in the center of some of the
crystals are merely placed for the purpose of hastening the
formation of the crystals.</p>

<p>E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENT</span> N<span class="smcapa">O</span>. 1.&mdash;Make a strong solution of alum, or of
sulphate of copper, or blue vitriol, and place in them rough
and irregular pieces of clinker from stoves, or wire baskets,
and set them by in a cool place, where they will be free
from dust, and in a few days crystals of the several salts
will deposit themselves on the baskets, &amp;c. They should
then be taken out of the solutions, and dried in an oven not
too hot, when they form very pretty ornaments for a room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENT</span> N<span class="smcapa">O</span>. 2.&mdash;Fill a Florence flask up to the neck
with a strong solution of sulphate of soda, or Glauber salt,
boil it, and tie the mouth over with a piece of moistened
bladder while boiling, and set it by in a place where it cannot
be disturbed. After twenty-four hours it will probably
still remain fluid. Pierce the bladder covering with a penknife,
and the percussion of the air will cause the whole
mass instantly to crystallize, and the flask will become quite
warm from the latent caloric, of which we have spoken before,
given out by the salt in passing from the fluid to the
solid state. It is better to prepare two or three flasks at
the same time, to provide against accidents, for the least
shake will often cause the crystallization to take place before
the proper time.</p>


<p class="p6">THE SPECTRAL LAMP.</p>

<p>Mix some common salt with spirit of wine in a platinum
or metallic cup; set the cup upon a wire frame over a
spirit-lamp, which should be inclosed on each side, or in a
dark-lantern: when the cup becomes heated, and the spirit
ignited, it will burn with a strong yellow flame: if, however,
it should not be perfectly yellow, throw more salt into
the cup. The lamp being thus prepared, all other lights
should be extinguished, and the yellow lamp introduced,
when an appalling change will be exhibited; all the objects
in the room but of one color, and the complexions of the
several persons, whether old or young, fair or brunette, will
be metamorphosed to a ghastly, death-like yellow; whilst
the gayest dresses, as the brightest crimson, the choicest
lilac, the most vivid blue or green&mdash;all will be changed into
one monotonous yellow: each person will be inclined to
laugh at his neighbor, himself insensible of being one of
the spectral company.</p>

<p>Their astonishment may be heightened by removing the
yellow light to one end of the room, and restoring the usual
or white light at the other; when one side of each person's
dress will resume its original color, while the other will
remain yellow; one cheek may bear the bloom of health,
and the other, the yellow of jaundice. Or if, when the yellow
light only is burning, the white light be introduced
within a wire sieve, the company and the objects in the
apartment will appear yellow, mottled with white.</p>

<p>Red light may be produced by mixing with the spirit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the cup over the lamp, salt of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'strontian'">strontium</ins> instead of common
salt; and the effect of the white or yellow lights, if introduced
through a sieve upon the red light, will be even
more striking than the white upon the yellow light.</p>


<p class="p6">CURIOUS CHANGE OF COLORS.</p>

<p>Let there be no other light than a taper in the room; then
put on a pair of dark green spectacles, and having closed
one eye, view the taper with the other. Suddenly remove
the spectacles, and the taper will assume a bright red appearance;
but if the spectacles be instantly replaced, the
eye will be unable to distinguish anything for a second or
two. The order of colors will, therefore, be as follows:
green, red, green, black.</p>


<p class="p6">THE PROTEAN LIGHT.</p>

<p>Soak a cotton wick in a strong solution of salt and water,
dry it, place it in a spirit lamp, and when lit it will give a
bright yellow light for a long time. If you look through a
piece of blue glass at the flame, it will <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'loose'">lose</ins> all its yellow
light, and you will only perceive feeble violet rays. If, before
the blue glass, you place a pale yellow glass, the lamp
will be absolutely invisible, though a candle may be distinctly
seen through the same glasses.</p>


<p class="p6">THE CHAMELEON FLOWERS.</p>

<p>Trim a spirit lamp, add a little salt to the wick, and light
it. Set near it a scarlet geranium, and the flower will appear
yellow. Purple colors, in the same light, appear blue.</p>


<p class="p6">TO CHANGE THE COLORS OF FLOWERS.</p>

<p>Hold over a lighted match a purple columbine, or a blue
larkspur, and it will change first to pink, and then to black.
The yellow of other flowers, held as above, will continue unchanged.
Thus, the purple tint will instantly disappear
from a heart's-ease, but the yellow will remain; and the
yellow of a wall-flower will continue the same, though the
brown streak will be discharged. If a scarlet, crimson, or
maroon dahlia be tried, the color will change to yellow; a
fact known to gardeners, who by this mode variegate their
growing dahlias.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">CHANGES OF THE POPPY.</p>

<p>Some flowers, which are red, become blue by merely
bruising them. Thus, if the petals of the common corn-poppy
be rubbed upon white paper, they will stain it purple,
which may be made green by washing it over with a strong
solution of potash in water. Put poppy petals into very
dilute muriatic acid, and the infusion will be of a florid red
color; by adding a little chalk, it will become of the color
of port wine; and this tint, by the addition of potash, may
be changed to green or yellow.</p>


<p class="p6">TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF A ROSE.</p>

<p>Hold a red rose over the blue flame of a common match,
and the color will be discharged wherever the fume touches
the leaves of the flower, so as to render it beautifully variegated,
or entirely white. If it be then dipped into water,
the redness, after a time, will be restored.</p>


<p class="p6">LIGHT CHANGING WHITE INTO BLACK.</p>

<p>Write upon linen with permanent ink (which is a strong
solution of nitrate of silver), and the characters will be
scarcely visible; remove the linen into a dark room, and
they will not change; but expose them to a strong light,
and they will be of an indelible black.</p>


<p class="p6">THE VISIBLY GROWING ACORN.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 169px;">
<img src="images/i_106.jpg" width="169" height="293" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Cut a circular piece of card to fit the top of a hyacinth-glass,
so as to rest upon the ledge, and exclude the air.
Pierce a hole through the center of the
card, and pass through it a strong
thread, having a small piece of wood
tied to one end, which, resting transversely
on the card, prevents its being
drawn through. To the other end of
the thread attach an acorn; and having
half filled the glass with water, suspend
the acorn at a short distance from the
surface.</p>

<p>The glass must be kept in a warm
room; and, in a few days, the steam
which has generated in the glass will
hang from the acorn in a large drop.
Shortly afterwards the acorn will burst,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the root will protrude and thrust itself into the water; and
in a few days more a stem will shoot out at the other end,
and rising upwards, will press against the card, in which
an orifice must be made to allow it to pass through. From
this stem, small leaves will soon be observed to sprout;
and in the course of a few weeks you will have a handsome
oak plant, several inches in height.</p>


<p class="p6">COLORED FLAMES.</p>

<p>A variety of rays of light are exhibited by colored flames,
which are not to be seen in white light. Thus, pure hydrogen
gas will burn with a blue flame, in which many of the
rays of light are wanting. The flame of an oil lamp contains
most of the rays which are wanting in the sunlight.
Alcohol, mixed with water, when heated or burned, affords
a flame with no other rays but yellow. The following
salts, if finely powdered, and introduced into the exterior
flame of a candle, or into the wick of a spirit lamp, will
communicate to the flame their peculiar colors:</p>


<div class="center">

<p>Or, either of the above salts may be mixed with spirit of
wine, as directed for Red Fire.</p>


<p class="p6">ORANGE COLORED FLAME.</p>

<p>Burn spirit of wine on chloride of calcium, a substance
obtained by evaporating muriate of lime to dryness.</p>


<p class="p6">EMERALD GREEN FLAME.</p>

<p>Burn spirit of wine on a little powdered nitrate of copper.</p>


<p class="p6">INSTANTANEOUS FLAME.</p>

<p>Heat together potassium and sulphur, and they will
instantly burn very vividly.</p>

<p>Heat a little niter on a fire-shovel, sprinkle on it flour of
sulphur, and it will instantly burn. If iron filings be thrown
upon red-hot niter, they will detonate and burn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Pound, separately, equal parts of chlorate of potash and
lump sugar; mix them, and put upon a plate a small quantity;
dip a glass rod into sulphuric acid, touch the powder
with it, and it will burst into a brilliant flame.</p>

<p>Or, put a few grains of chlorate of potash into a tablespoonful
of spirit of wine; add one or two drops of sulphuric
acid, and the whole will burst into a beautiful flame.</p>


<p class="p6">TO COOL FLAME BY METAL.</p>

<p>Encircle the very small flame of a floating night light,
with a cold iron wire, which will instantly cause its
extinction.</p>


<p class="p6">PROOF THAT FLAME IS HOLLOW.</p>

<p>Pour some spirit of wine into a watch-glass, and inflame
it; place a straw across this flame, and it will only be ignited
and charred at the outer edge; the middle of the straw
will be uninjured, for there is no ignited matter in the center
of the flame.</p>


<p class="p6">TO HOLD A HOT TEA KETTLE ON THE HAND.</p>

<p>Be sure that the bottom of the kettle is well covered
with soot; when the water in it boils, remove it from the
fire, and place it upon the palm of the hand; no inconvenience
will be felt, as the soot will prevent the heat being
transmitted from the water within and the heated metal,
to the hand.</p>


<p class="p6">INCOMBUSTIBLE LINEN.</p>

<p>Make a strong solution of borax in water, and steep in it
linen, muslin, or any article of clothing; when dry, they
cannot easily be inflamed. A solution of phosphate of
ammonia with sal ammoniac answers much better.</p>


<p class="p6">THE BURNING CIRCLE.</p>

<p>Light a stick, and whirl it round with a rapid motion,
when its burning end will produce a complete circle of
light, although that end can only be in one part of the circle
at the same instant. This is caused by the duration of
the impression of light upon the retina. Another example
is, that during the winking of the eye we never lose sight
of the object we are viewing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">WATER OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES IN THE SAME VESSEL.</p>

<p>Of heat and cold, as of wit and madness, it may be said
that "thin partitions do their bounds divide." Thus, paint
one half of the surface of a tin pot with a mixture of lamp-black
and size, and leave the other half, or side, bright;
fill the vessel with boiling water, and by dipping a thermometer,
or even the finger, into it shortly after, it will be
found to cool much more rapidly upon the blackened than
upon the bright side of the pot.</p>


<p class="p6">WARMTH OF DIFFERENT COLORS.</p>

<p>Place upon the surface of snow, as upon the window sill,
in bright daylight or sunshine, pieces of cloth of the same
size and quality, but of different colors, black, blue, green,
yellow, and white: the black cloth will soon melt the snow
beneath it, and sink downwards; next the blue, and then
the green; the yellow but slightly; but the snow beneath
the white cloth will be as firm as at first.</p>


<p class="p6">SUBSTITUTE FOR FIRE.</p>

<p>Put into a cup a lump of quicklime, fresh from the kiln,
pour water upon it, and the heat will be very great. A
pailful of quicklime, if dipped in water, and shut closely
into a box constructed for the purpose, will give out sufficient
heat to warm a room, even in very cold weather.
This is the source of steam vapor in theatrical representations.</p>


<p class="p6">LAUGHING GAS.</p>

<p>The above fanciful appellation has been given to nitrous
oxide, from the very agreeable sensations excited by inhaling
it. In its pure state it destroys animal life, but loses
this noxious quality when inhaled, because it becomes
blended with the atmospheric air which it meets in the
lungs. This gas is made by putting three or four drams
of nitrate of ammonia, in crystals, into a small glass retort,
which being held over a spirit lamp, the crystals will melt,
and the gas be evolved.</p>

<p>Having thus produced the gas, it is to be passed into a
large bladder, having a stop-cock; and when you are desirous
of exhibiting its effects, you cause the person who
wishes to experience them, to first exhale the atmospheric
air from the lungs, and then quickly placing the cock in his
mouth, you turn it, and bid him inhale the gas. Immediately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a sense of extraordinary cheerfulness, fanciful flights
of imagination, an uncontrollable propensity to laughter,
and a consciousness of being capable of great muscular
exertion, supervene. It does not operate in exactly the
same manner on all persons; but in most cases the sensations
are agreeable, and have this important difference
from those produced by wine or spirituous liquors, that
they are not succeeded by any depression of mind.</p>


<p class="p6">FLAME FROM COLD METALS.</p>

<p>Provide a bottle of the gas chlorine, which may be purchased
of any operative chemist, and with it you may
exhibit some brilliant experiments.</p>

<p>For example, reduce a small piece of the metal antimony
to a very fine powder in a mortar; place some of this on
a bent card, then loosen the stopper of the bottle of chlorine,
and throw in the antimony; it will take fire spontaneously,
and burn with much splendor, thus exhibiting a cold
metal spontaneously bursting into flame.</p>

<p>If, however, a lump of antimony be dropped into the
chlorine, there will be no spontaneous combustion, nor immediate
change; but, in the course of time, the antimony will
become incrusted with a white powder, and no chlorine will
be found in the bottle.</p>

<p>Or, provide copper in fine leaves, known as "Dutch
metal;" slightly breathe on one end of a glass rod, about
ten inches long, and cause one or two leaves of the metal
to adhere to the damp end; then open a bottle of chlorine,
quickly plunge in the leaves, when they will instantly take
fire, and burn with a fine red light, leaving in the bottle a
greenish-yellow solid substance.</p>

<p>A small <em>lump</em> of copper, or "Dutch metal," will not burn
as above, but will be slowly acted upon, like the antimony.</p>

<p>Immerse gold leaf in a jar of chlorine gas, and combustion
with a beautiful green flame will take place.</p>


<p class="p6">PHOSPHORUS IN CHLORINE.</p>

<p>Put into a deflagrating spoon about four grains of phosphorus,
and let it down into a bottle of chlorine, when the
phosphorus will ignite instantaneously.</p>

<p>Or, fold a slip of blotting-paper into a match five inches
long; dip it into oil of turpentine, drain it an instant, drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
it into another bottle of chlorine, when it will burst into a
flame, and deposit much carbon.</p>


<p class="p6">MAGIC VAPOR.</p>

<p>Provide a glass tube, about three feet long and half an
inch in diameter; nearly fill it with water, upon the surface
of which pour a little colored ether; then close the open
end of the tube carefully with the palm of the hand, invert
it in a basin of water, and rest the tube against the wall:
the ether will rise through the water to the upper end of
the tube; pour a little hot water over the tube, and it will
soon cause the ether to boil within, and its vapor may thus
be made to drive nearly all the water out of the tube into
the basin; if, however, you then cool the tube by pouring
cold water over it, the vaporized ether will again become a
liquid, and float upon the water as before.</p>


<p class="p6">GAS FROM THE UNION OF METAL.</p>

<p>Nearly fill a wine-glass with diluted sulphuric acid, and
place in it a wire of silver and another of zinc, taking care
that they do not touch each other; when the zinc will be
changed by the acid, but the silver will remain inert. But
cause the upper ends of the wires to touch each other, and
a stream of gas will issue from them.</p>


<p class="p6">CAMPHOR SUBLIMED BY FLAME.</p>

<p>Set a metallic plate over the flame of a spirit lamp; place
upon it a small portion of camphor under a glass funnel;
and the camphor will be beautifully sublimed by the heat of
the lamp, in an efflorescent crust on the sides of the funnel.</p>


<p class="p6">GREEN FIRE.</p>

<p>A beautiful green fire may be thus made. Take of flour
of sulphur thirteen parts, nitrate of baryta seventy-seven,
oxymuriate of potassa five, metallic arsenic two, and
charcoal three. Let the nitrate of baryta be well dried and
powdered; then add to it the other ingredients, all finely
pulverized, and exceedingly well mixed and rubbed together.
Place a portion of the composition in a small tin pan, having
a polished reflector fitted to one side, and set light to it;
when a splendid green illumination will be the result. By
adding a little calamine, it will burn more slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">BRILLIANT RED FIRE.</p>

<p>Weigh five ounces of dry nitrate of strontia, one ounce
and a half of finely powdered sulphur, five drams of chlorate
of potash, and four drams of sulphuret of antimony. Powder
the chlorate of potash and the sulphuret of antimony separately
in a mortar, and mix them on paper; after which add
them to the other ingredients, previously powdered and
mixed. No other kind of mixture than rubbing together on
paper is required. For use, mix with a portion of the
powder a small quantity of spirits of wine, in a tin pan resembling
a cheese toaster, light the mixture, and it will shed a
rich crimson hue. When the fire burns dim and badly, a
very small quantity of finely powdered charcoal or lamp
black will revive it.</p>


<p class="p6">PURPLE FIRE.</p>

<p>Dissolve chloride of lithium in spirit of wine, and when
lighted, it will burn with a purplish flame.</p>


<p class="p6">SILVER FIRE.</p>

<p>Place upon a piece of burning charcoal a morsel of the
dried crystals of nitrate of silver (not the lunar caustic),
and it will immediately throw out the most beautiful sparks
that can be imagined, whilst the surface of the charcoal will
be coated with silver.</p>


<p class="p6">THE FIERY FOUNTAIN.</p>

<p>Put into a glass tumbler fifteen grains of finely granulated
zinc, and six grains of phosphorus, cut into very small pieces
beneath water. Mix in another glass, gradually, a dram
of sulphuric acid, with two drams of water. Remove both
glasses into a dark room, and there pour the diluted acid
over the zinc and phosphorus in the glass; in a short time
beautiful jets of bluish flame will dart from all parts of the
surface of the mixture; it will become quite luminous, and
beautiful luminous smoke will rise in a column from the
glass, thus representing a fountain of fire.</p>


<p class="p6">COMBUSTION WITHOUT FLAME.</p>

<p>Light a small <em>green</em> wax taper; in a minute or two, blow
out the flame, and the wick will continue red hot for
many hours; and if the taper were regularly and carefully
uncoiled, and the room kept free from the current of air, the
wick would burn on in this manner until the whole was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
consumed. The same effect is not produced when the color
of the wax is red, on which account red wax tapers are
safer than green, for the latter, if left imperfectly extinguished,
may set fire to any object with which they are in
contact.</p>


<p class="p6">COMBUSTION OF THREE METALS.</p>

<p>Mix a grain or two of potassium with an equal quantity
of sodium; add a globule of quicksilver, and the three
metals, when shaken, will take fire, and burn vividly.</p>


<p class="p6">TO MAKE PAPER APPARENTLY INCOMBUSTIBLE.</p>

<p>Take a smooth cylindrical piece of metal, about one inch
and a half in diameter, and eight inches long; wrap very
closely round it a piece of clean writing paper, then hold
the paper in the flame of a spirit lamp, and it will not take
fire; but it may be held there for a considerable time, without
being in the least affected by the flame. If the paper
be strained over a cylinder of wood, it is quickly scorched.</p>


<p class="p6">HEAT NOT TO BE ESTIMATED BY TOUCH.</p>

<p>Hold both hands in water which causes the thermometer
to rise to ninety degrees, and when the liquid has become
still, you will be insensible to the heat, and that the hand is
touching anything. Then remove one hand to water that
causes the thermometer to rise to two hundred degrees, and
the other in water at thirty-two degrees. After holding the
hands thus for some time, remove them, and again immerse
them in the water at ninety degrees; when you will find
<em>warmth</em> in one hand and <em>cold</em> in the other. To the hand
which had been immersed in the water at thirty-two degrees,
the water at ninety degrees will feel hot; and to the hand
which had been immersed in the water at two hundred
degrees, the water at ninety degrees will feel cool. If, therefore,
the touch in this case be trusted, the same water will
be judged to be hot and cold at the <em>same</em> time.</p>


<p class="p6">FLAME UPON WATER.</p>

<p>Fill a wine glass with cold water, pour lightly upon its
surface a little ether; light it by a slip of paper, and it will
burn for some time.</p>


<p class="p6">ROSE-COLORED FLAME UPON WATER.</p>

<p>Drop a globule of potassium, about the size of a large pea,
into as small cup, nearly full of water, containing a drop or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
two of strong nitric acid; the moment that the metal touches
the liquid, it will float upon its surface, enveloped with a
beautiful rose-colored flame, and entirely dissolve.</p>


<p class="p6">TO SET A MIXTURE ON FIRE WITH WATER.</p>

<p>Pour into a saucer a little sulphuric acid, and place upon
it a chip of sodium, which will float and remain uninflamed;
but the addition of a drop of water will set it on fire.</p>


<p class="p6">WAVES OF FIRE ON WATER.</p>

<p>On a lump of refined sugar let fall a few drops of phosphuretted
ether, and put the sugar into a glass of warm
water, which will instantly appear on fire at the surface,
and in waves, if gently blown with the breath. This experiment
should be exhibited in the dark.</p>


<p class="p6">WATER FROM THE FLAME OF A CANDLE.</p>

<p>Hold a cold and dry bell glass over a lighted candle, and
watery vapor will be directly condensed on the cold surface;
then close the mouth of the glass with a card or plate, and
turn the mouth uppermost; remove the card, quickly pour
in a little lime-water, a perfectly clear liquid, and it will
instantly become turbid and milky, upon meeting with the
contents of the glass, just as lime-water changes when
dropped into a glass full of water.</p>


<p class="p6">FORMATION OF WATER BY FIRE.</p>

<p>Put into a tea cup a little spirit of wine, set it on fire, and
invert a large bell-glass over it. In a short time, a thick
watery vapor will be seen upon the inside of the bell, which
may be collected by a dry sponge.</p>


<p class="p6">BOILING UPON COLD WATER.</p>

<p>Provide a tall glass jar, filled with cold water, and place
in it an air thermometer, which will nearly reach the surface;
upon the surface place a small copper basin, into
which put a little live charcoal: the surface of the water
will soon be made to boil, while the thermometer will show
that the water beneath is scarcely warmer than it was at
first.</p>


<p class="p6">CURRENTS IN BOILING WATER.</p>

<p>Fill a large glass tube with water, and throw into it a
few particles of bruised amber, then hold the tube by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
handle for the purpose, upright in the flame of a lamp, and
as the water becomes warm, it will be seen that currents,
carrying with them the pieces of amber, will begin to ascend
in the center, and to descend towards the circumference of
the tube. These currents will soon become rapid in their
motions, and continue till the water boils.</p>


<p class="p6">HOT WATER LIGHTER THAN COLD.</p>

<p>Pour into a glass tube, about ten inches long, and one
inch in diameter, a little water colored with pink or other
dye; then fill it up gradually and carefully with colorless
water, so as not to mix them; apply heat at the bottom of
the tube, and the colored water will ascend and be diffused
throughout the whole.</p>

<p>The circulation of warm water may be very pleasingly
shown, by heating water in a tube similar to the foregoing;
the water having diffused in it some particles of any light
substance not soluble in water.</p>


<p class="p6">EXPANSION OF WATER BY COLD.</p>

<p>All fluids, except water, diminish in bulk till they freeze.
Thus, fill a large thermometer tube with water, say of the
temperature of eighty degrees, and then plunge the bulb
into pounded ice and salt, or any other freezing mixture:
the water will go on shrinking in the tube till it has attained
the temperature of about forty degrees; and then, instead
of continuing to contract till it freezes, (as in the case
with all other liquids), it will be seen slowly to expand,
and consequently to rise in the tube, until it congeals. In
this case, the expansion below forty degrees, and above
forty degrees, seem to be equal; so that the water will be
of the same bulk at thirty-two degrees as at forty-eight
degrees, that is, at eight degrees above or below forty degrees.</p>


<p class="p6">THE CUP OF TANTALUS.</p>

<p>This pretty toy may be purchased at any optician's for
two or three shillings. It consists of a cup, in which is
placed a standing human figure, concealing a syphon, or
bent tube with one end longer than the other. This rises
in one leg of the figure to reach the chin, and descends
through the other leg, through the bottom of the cup to a
reservoir beneath. If you pour water in the cup, it will rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in the shorter leg by its upward pressure, driving out the
air before it through the longer leg; and when the cup is
filled above the bend of the syphon, (that is, level with the
chin of the figure,) the pressure of the water will force it
over into the longer leg of the syphon, and the cup will be
emptied: the toy thus imitating Tantalus of mythology, who
is represented by the poets as punished in Erebus with an
insatiable thirst, and placed up to the chin in a pool of
water, which, however, flowed away as soon as he attempted
to taste it.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MAGIC WHIRLPOOL.</p>

<p>Fill a glass tumbler with water, throw upon its surface a
few fragments or thin shavings of camphor, and they will
instantly begin to move, and acquire a motion both progressive
and rotary, which will continue for a considerable
time. During these rotations, if the water be touched
by any substance which is at all greasy, the floating particles
will quickly dart back, and as if by a stroke of magic,
be instantly deprived of their motion and vivacity.</p>

<p>In like manner, if thin slices of cork be steeped in sulphuric
ether in a closed bottle for two or three days, and
then placed upon the water, they will rotate for several
minutes, like the camphor; until the slices of cork having
discharged all their ether, and become soaked with water,
they will keep at rest.</p>

<p>If the water be made hot, the motion of the camphor will
be more rapid than in cold water, but it will cease in proportionately
less time. Thus, provide two glasses, one containing
water at fifty-eight degrees, and the other at two
hundred and ten degrees; place raspings of camphor upon
each at the same time; the camphor in the first glass will
rotate for about five hours, until all but a very minute portion
has evaporated, while the rotation of the camphor in
the hot water will last only nineteen minutes: about half
the camphor will pass off, and the remaining pieces, instead
of being dull, white, and opaque, will be vitreous and transparent,
and evidently soaked with water. The gyrations,
too, which at first will be very rapid, will gradually decline
in velocity, until they become quite sluggish.</p>

<p>The stilling influence of oil upon waves has become proverbial:
the extraordinary manner in which a small quantity
of oil instantly spreads over a very large surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
troubled water, and the stealthy manner in which even a
rough wind glides over it, must have excited the admiration
of all who have witnessed it.</p>

<p>By the same principle a drop of oil may be made to stop
the motion of the camphor, as follows: Throw some camphor,
both in slices and in small particles, upon the surface
of water, and while they are rotating, dip a glass rod into
oil of turpentine, and allow a single drop thereof to trickle
down the inner side of the glass to the surface of the water;
the camphor will instantly dart to the opposite point of the
liquid surface, and cease to rotate. If a piece of hard tallow
or lard be employed, the motion of the camphor will be
more slowly stopped than by oil or fluid grease, as the latter
spreads over the surface of the water with greater rapidity.</p>

<p>If a few drops of sulphuric or muriatic acid be let fall
into the water, they will gradually stop the motion of the
camphor; but if camphor be dropped into nitric acid diluted
with its own bulk of water, it will rotate rapidly for a few
seconds, and then stop.</p>

<p>If a piece of the rotating camphor be attentively examined
with a lens, the currents of the water can be well distinguished,
jetting out, chiefly from the corners of the camphor,
and bearing it round with irregular force.</p>

<p>The currents, as given out by the camphor, may also be
seen by means of the microscope; a drop or two of pure
water being placed upon a slip of glass, with a particle of
camphor floating upon it. By this means the current may
be detected, and it will be seen that they cause the rotations.</p>

<p>Or a flat watch-glass, called a <em>lunar</em>, may be employed,
raised a few inches, and supported on a wire ring, kept
steady by thrusting one end into an upright piece of wood,
like a retort stand. Then put the camphor and water in
the watch-glass, and place under the frame a sheet of white
paper, so that it may receive the shadow of the glass, camphor,
&amp;c., to be cast by a steady light, placed above, and
somewhat on one side of the watch glass. On observing
the shadow, which may be considered a magnified representation
of the object itself, the rotations and currents can
be distinguished.</p>


<p class="p6">ARTIFICIAL FIRE BALLS.</p>

<p>Put thirty grains of phosphorus into a bottle, which contains
three or four ounces of water. Place the vessel over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a lamp, and give it a boiling heat. Balls of fire will soon
be seen to issue from the water, after the manner of an artificial
fire-work, attended with the most beautiful coruscations.</p>


<p class="p6">TO MELT STEEL AS EASILY AS LEAD.</p>

<p>Make a piece of steel red in the fire, then hold it with a
pair of pincers or tongs; take in the other hand a stick of
brimstone, and touch the piece of steel with it. Immediately
after their contact, you will see the steel melt and drop like
a liquid.</p>


<p class="p6">TO TELL A LADY IF SHE IS IN LOVE.</p>

<p>Put into a phial some sulphuric ether, color it red with
orchanet, then saturate the tincture with spermaceti. This
preparation is solid ten degrees above freezing point, and
melts and boils at twenty degrees. Place the phial which
contains it in a lady's hand, and tell her that if in love, the
solid mass will dissolve. In a few minutes the substance
will become fluid.</p>


<p class="p6">AN EGG PUT INTO A PHIAL.</p>

<p>To accomplish this seemingly incredible act, requires the
following preparation: You must take an egg and soak it
in strong vinegar; and in process of time its shell will
become quite soft, so that it may be extended lengthways
without breaking; then insert it into the neck of a small
bottle, and by pouring cold water upon it, it will reassume
its former figure and hardness. This is really a complete
curiosity, and baffles those who are not in the secret to find
out how it is accomplished. If the vinegar used to saturate
the egg is not sufficiently strong to produce the required
softness of shell, add one teaspoonful of strong acetic acid
to every two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. This will render
the egg perfectly flexible, and of easy insertion into the
bottle, which must then be filled with cold water.</p>


<p class="p6">TO ASTONISH A LARGE PARTY.</p>

<p>With some lycopodium, powder the surface of a large or
small vessel of water; you may then challenge any one to
drop a piece of money into the water, and that you will get
it with the hand without wetting your skin. The lycopodium
adheres to the hand, and prevents its contact with the
water. A little shake of the hand, after the feat is over,
will dislodge the powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">TEST PAPERS.</p>

<p>On the otherwise barren rocks which fringe the shore of
the Cape de Verd Islands, grows the archil&mdash;a famous seaweed
or lichen, renowned among dyers. By a particular
process of manufacture, this archil yields a beautiful blue
pigment, known in the chemical laboratory by the name of
<em>litmus</em>. Few colors are more fugitive than litmus. Being a
fine violet-blue, it is changed to red by so minute a portion
of any acid, that it becomes, when properly applied, <em>a test</em>
of the presence of the latter substance. As it is so frequently
desirable to know whether a fluid be acid or
alkaline, one of the first practical lessons to a student in
chemistry, is to prepare litmus test paper, thus: Put into
a flask half an ounce of litmus, and three ounces of water;
let them remain together in a warm place for a few hours,
then filter the dark blue liquid from its impurities, divide
the solution obtained into two parts, pour one portion into
a saucer, and soak strips of white writing paper in it until
it has acquired a distinct blue color. If not colored enough
by once dipping and drying, repeat the operation. When
dry, preserve these strips in a box, labeled "Blue litmus
test papers." These serve to <em>test</em> any fluid, to ascertain if
it has an <em>acid</em> reaction. It is instructive to learn how very
small a portion of any acid in water will be indicated by
the reddening of the litmus. With the second portion of
the fluid, mix, cautiously, a few drops of lemon juice, until
it is red; then color paper as before. When dry, this "red
litmus test paper" serves to indicate the presence of alkalies,
a class of bodies opposed to acids. Red litmus test
paper, on being put into any fluid that is <em>alkaline</em>, such as
lime-water, is immediately restored to its original blue color.
Put the ashes of a cigar into water, the liquid, when "tested,"
will indicate the presence of an alkali. Test some stale
milk. If your blue paper becomes red, the milk is sour; it
is acid.</p>


<p class="p6">INFINITE DIVISIBILITY OF MATTER.</p>

<p>Dissolve a single grain of copper in about one dram of
nitric acid, and dilute the solution with about one ounce of
water, when it will be evident that a single drop of the mixture
must contain an almost immeasurably small portion of
copper. Yet, if the blade of a knife be dipped into it, it will
become covered with a coat of copper; thus showing that
the copper can be infinitely divided without any alteration
in its properties.</p>

<p class="p6">THE ORIGIN OF GALVANISM.</p>

<p>Electricity is one of the most active principles in nature.
It exists in all bodies, and is exhibited by various means,
one of which, and the most generally employed, is friction;
but the bodies rubbed together must consist of different
substances; for, if they are alike, electricity will not be
evolved. Some substances, such as soot, charcoal, iron,
gold, silver, copper, and other metals, water, &amp;c., are called
<em>good conductors</em>, because they transfer with great facility to
other bodies the electric fluid, which glides over the surface
with the velocity of light; while others, such as silk, wool,
hair, feathers, dry paper, leather, glass, wax, &amp;c., are called
<em>non-conductors</em>, because they resist the progress of the fluid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
which accumulates all the time the friction continues. It
is from these media that are obtained the usual phenomena
of electricity, as exhibited in the experiments which we shall
hereafter describe. Its effects are felt in almost every part
of nature; the awful lightning is the exhibition of the electric
fluid, which accumulates in the clouds, and which is
discharged when the heavy lurid masses come in contact
with each other; the mysterious sweeping whirlwind, the
terrific rising and rolling of the sand in the desert wilds of
Africa, and the beautiful yet evanescent Aurora Borealis of
the northern climes, are amongst a few of its effects.</p>

<p>The next branch of the science of Electricity is G<span class="smcapa">ALVANISM</span>,
or, as it is sometimes called, Voltaic Electricity; it is obtained
through the simple contact of different conducting
bodies with each other. It was first discovered at Bologna,
in the year 1791, by the lady of Louis Galvani, an Italian
philosopher of great merit, and professor of anatomy; from
whom, indeed, the science received its name. His wife
being possessed of a penetrating understanding, and passionately
loving him, took a lively interest in the science
which so much occupied his attention. At the time the incident
we are about to narrate took place, she was in a declining
state of health, and taking soup made of frogs, by
way of restorative. Some of these animals, skinned for the
purpose, happened to be lying on the table of Galvani's
laboratory, where also stood an electrical machine, when
the point of a knife was unintentionally brought into contact
with the nerves of one of the frog's legs, which lay close
to the conductor of the machine, and immediately the muscles
of the limb were violently agitated. Madame Galvani
having observed the phenomenon, instantly informed her
husband of it, and this incident led to the experiments and
interesting discoveries which will transmit his name to the
latest posterity.</p>

<p>The uses of Galvanic Electricity for scientific purposes
are incalculable; and its phenomena are so various and
extraordinary, as to render the study of this science exceedingly
interesting. Through means of a galvanic battery,
substances are decomposed, colors changed, water is made
inflammable, and motion is given to lifeless bodies.</p>

<p>The experiments we give on Galvanism show the effect
of the combination which forms what is called a simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
galvanic circle, by means of two metals, zinc and silver, or
zinc and copper, and water.</p>

<p>Galvanic action is always accompanied by chemical action,
and all that is necessary to disturb the galvanic fluid
is to unite two metals together, and subject them to the
action of a fluid, which will act chemically upon one of
them, differently to what it does upon the other.</p>

<p>A galvanic circle may also be formed of one metal, and
two different fluids, which have a different action upon the
metal.</p>

<p>Magnetism is a modification of electricity: at least, there
is sufficient evidence that these causes are intimately connected,
if not identical; but philosophers are as yet ignorant
of its nature.</p>

<p>The property designated by the word magnetism is found
in an iron ore of a certain composition, and of a dark gray
color and peculiar luster. This ore alone is the local habitation
of magnetism, whilst all others are subject to its
influence, or to be attracted by it. Still, so little difference
is there between the magnetic ore, or loadstone, and those
which do not possess the property, that only practiced mineralogists
can discern one from the other; and an experienced
eye may see two ores join each other by the principle
of attraction, without knowing in which resides the power,
until another ore, non-magnetic, is brought within the sphere
of attraction, when it will adhere only to that which contains
the principle.</p>

<p>This singular property of the loadstone is imparted to
other metallic substances, by rubbing and keeping them
close together for some length of time: if a metal be of a
hard texture like steel, it retains the magnetic principle
permanently; but if soft, it loses the power as soon as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'seperated'">separated</ins>
from the magnet. The metals thus prepared, acquire
the same directive and attractive power as the loadstone or
natural magnet, and are employed for purposes of the
utmost importance.</p>

<p>We proceed to give the youthful amateur the opportunity
of exemplifying the principles of electricity, galvanism, and
magnetism, by several simple experiments.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Lay a watch down upon
a table, and on its face balance
a tobacco-pipe very carefully.
Next take a wine-glass, rub it
quickly with a silk handkerchief,
and hold it for half a minute
before the fire; then apply it near to the end of the pipe,
and the latter, attracted by the electricity evolved by the
friction and warmth in the former, will immediately follow
it; and by carrying the glass around, always in front of
the pipe, the latter will continue its rotatory motion; the
watch-glass being the center or pivot on which it acts.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Warm a glass tube, rub it with a warm flannel, and
then bring a downy feather near it. On the first moment
of contact, the feather will adhere to the glass, but soon
after will fly rapidly from it, and you may drive it about
the room by holding the glass between it and the surrounding
objects; should it, however, come in contact with anything
not under the influence of electricity, it will instantly
fly back to the glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>3.&mdash;A stick of sealing-wax rubbed against a warm piece
of flannel or cloth, acquires the property of attracting light
substances, such as small pieces of paper, lint, &amp;c., if
instantly applied at the distance of about an inch.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;Suspend two small pith balls, by fine silken threads
of about six inches in length, in such a manner, that when
at rest they may hang in contact with each other; on applying
a piece of sealing wax, excited as in the former experiment,
they will repel each other.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;Take a piece of common brown paper, about the size
of an octavo book, hold it before the fire till quite dry and
hot, then draw it briskly under the arm several times, so as
to rub it on both sides at once by the coat. The paper will
be found so powerfully electrical, that if placed against a
wainscoted or papered wall of a room, it will remain there
for some minutes without falling.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;And if, while the paper adheres to the wall, a light
fleecy feather be placed against it, it will be attracted to
the paper, in the same way as the paper is attracted to the
wall.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;If the paper be again warmed, and drawn under the
arm as before, and hung up by a thread attached to one
corner of it, it will hold up several feathers on each side;
should these fall off from different sides at the same time,
they will cling together very strongly; and if after a minute
they be all shaken off, they will fly to one another in a
very singular manner.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;Warm and excite the paper as before, lay it on a
table, and place upon it a ball made of elder pith, about the
size of a pea; the ball will immediately run across the
paper, and if a needle be pointed towards it, it will again
run to another part, and so on for a considerable time.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;Support a pane of glass, previously warmed, upon
two books, one at each end, and place some bran underneath;
then rub the upper side of the glass with a black
silk handkerchief, or a piece of flannel, and the bran will
dance up and down under it with much rapidity.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;Place your left hand upon the throat of a cat, and
with the middle finger and the thumb, press slightly the
bones of the animal's shoulders; then, if the right hand be
gently passed along the back, perceptible shocks of electricity
will be felt in the left hand. Shocks may also be
obtained by touching the tips of the ears after rubbing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
back. If the color of the cat be black, and the experiment
be made in a dark room, the electric sparks may be very
plainly seen. Very distinct charges of electricity may also
be obtained by touching the tips of the ears after applying
friction to the back, and the same may be obtained from the
foot. Placing the cat on your knees, apply the right hand
to the back; the left fore paw resting on the palm of your
left hand, apply the thumb to the upper side of the paw, so
as to extend the claws, and by this means, bring your fore
finger into contact with one of the bones of the leg, where
it joins the paw; when, from the knob or end of this bone,
the finger slightly pressing on it, you may feel distinctly
successive shocks, similar to those obtained from the ears.
It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add, that, in order to this
experiment being conveniently performed, the experimenter
must be on good terms with the cat.</p>


<p class="p6">ELECTRICAL SHOCK FROM A SHEET OF PAPER.</p>

<p>Place an iron japanned tea tray on a dry, clean, beaker
glass; then take a sheet of foolscap writing paper, and
hold it close to the fire until all its hygrometric moisture is
dissipated, but not so as to scorch it; in this state it is one
of the finest electrics we have. Hold one end down on a
table with the finger and thumb, and give it about a dozen
strokes with a large piece of India rubber from the left to
the right, beginning at the top. Now take it up by two of
the corners and bring it over the tray, and it will fall down
on it like a stone; if one finger be now brought under the
tray, a sensible shock will be felt. Now lay a needle on
the tray with its point projecting outwards, remove the
paper, and a star sign of the negative electricity will be
seen: return the paper, and the positive brush will appear.
In fact, it forms a very extemporaneous electrophorus,
which will give a spark an inch long, and strong enough to
set fire to some combustible bodies, and to exhibit all the
electric phenomena not requiring coated surfaces. If four
beaker glasses are placed on the floor, and a book laid
on them, a person may stand on them insulated; if he then
holds the tray vertically, the paper will adhere strongly to
it, and sparks may be drawn from any part of his body;
or he may draw sparks from any other person, as the case
may be; or he may set fire to some inflammable bodies, by
touching them with a piece of ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">LIGHT UNDER WATER.</p>

<p>Rub two pieces of fine lump sugar together in the dark,
and a bright electric light will be produced. The same
effect, but in a more intense degree, may be produced with
two pieces of silex or quartz, the white quartz being best
for this purpose. The same effect may also be witnessed
by rubbing the pieces of quartz together, <em>under water</em>.</p>


<p class="p6">SIMPLE MEANS OF PRODUCING ELECTRICITY.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 48px;">
<img src="images/i_126a.jpg" width="48" height="216" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To show the nature of electrical action, rub a piece of
sealing-wax or amber upon the coat sleeve, and it will be
found that while warm by the friction, it attracts light
bodies, such as straws or small pieces of paper. In our experiments
we have shown that if a clean glass tube be
rubbed several times through a silken or leather cloth, and
presented to any substance, it will immediately attract or
repel them; and if a poker suspended by a dry silk
string be presented to its upper end, then the lower
end of the poker will exhibit the same phenomena
as the tube itself, which shows that the electrical
fluid passes through the metal. But if for a metallic
body a stick of glass or sealing wax be substituted,
these phenomena will not occur, which proves that
the electrical fluid does not pass through these substances.</p>

<p>By this it will be perceived that besides the class
of bodies called electrics, there is another which we
call conductors. These bodies cannot be excited
themselves, but have the power of transmitting the
electric fluid through them. These bodies comprise all the
metals, some metal and metallic ores; the fluids of animal
bodies; water, and other fluids, except oil; ice, snow, earthy
substances, smoke, steam, and even a vacuum.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 143px;">
<img src="images/i_126b.jpg" width="143" height="205" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When any electrified conductor is wholly
surrounded by non-conductors, so that the
electric fluid cannot pass from the conductor
along conductors to the earth, it is
said to be insulated. Thus the human body
is a conductor of electricity; but if a

in the drawing) be charged
with electricity, the electric fluid cannot
pass from him to the earth, and he is said
to be <em>positively electrified</em>, because he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
more than his natural share; he is also <em>insulated</em>, and if he
be touched by another person standing on the ground, sparks
will be exhibited at the point of contact, where also the
person touching will feel a pricking sensation.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate certain remarkable facts in this
science of an amusing character, attention must be directed
to the figure <span class="smcapa">A B</span>, which is a metal stand; <span class="smcapa">C</span> is a small piece
of cork or pith, which is suspended from the hook by a dry
silken thread. Having rubbed an electron, as a dry rod of
glass, and presented it to <span class="smcapa">C</span>, the ball will be instantaneously
attracted to the glass, and will adhere to it.
After they remain in contact for a few
seconds, if the glass be withdrawn without
being touched by the fingers, and again
presented to the ball, the latter will be <em>repelled</em>
instead of attracted, as in the first instance.
By being touched with the finger,
the ball can be deprived of its electricity,
and if, after this has been done, we present
a piece of sealing-wax in place of the glass
formerly employed, the very same phenomena
will take place. On the first application the ball will be
<em>attracted</em>, and on the second <em>repelled</em>.</p>

<p>Before the young reader can perform any very important
experiments with electricity, he must become possessed of
an <span class="smcapa">ELECTRICAL MACHINE</span>, which is an instrument contrived for
the purpose of rubbing together the surfaces of electrics
and non-electrics. They generally consist of a cylinder, or
plate of glass, and a piece of silk for it to rub against,
covered with an amalgam, the method of preparing which
we shall hereafter describe.</p>


<p class="p6">HOW TO MAKE AN ELECTRICAL MACHINE.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/i_127b.jpg" width="279" height="76" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is very easy to make a glass machine of the cylindrical
form, if the maker cannot afford to buy one. First procure
a common wine bottle of good dimensions, and thickish glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Drill a hole through its bottom, by igniting a piece of worsted
tied round round it, dipped in turpentine, which will do
this. Through this hole and the mouth pass a spindle, as
represented in the cut. The end of <span class="smcapa">B</span> should be squared to
fix a handle on, and the spindle should be fixed firmly in the
bottle. The bottle is then to be fixed in a frame, in the following
manner: The end of the spindle <span class="smcapa">C</span> passes through
a hole at <span class="smcapa">B</span>; and the other end at <span class="smcapa">C</span> has the handle for turning
the machine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/i_128b.jpg" width="101" height="102" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>CUSHION.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Next make a cushion of wash-leather, stuffed with wool,
and fastened to the top of a frame of the following figure.
This frame is to be of such a height that the
cushion shall press against the sides of the
bottle, and a piece of black silk is sewn on to
the top of the cushion, and hangs over the
bottle <span class="smcapa">D</span>. The cushion should be smeared with
an amalgam, formed by melting together in
the bowl of a tobacco pipe, one part of tin with
two of zinc; to which, while fluid, should be added six parts
of mercury. These should be stirred about till quite cold,
and then reduced to a fine powder in a mortar, and mixed
with a sufficient quantity of lard to form a thickish paste.
When all is done, the machine is complete.</p>


<p class="p6">CONDUCTOR.</p>

<p>The electricity being generated by the friction produced
between the rubber and the bottle from the motion imparted
by the handle, it is necessary to draw it off for use. This
is performed by what is called a conductor. This is made
in the following manner: At right angles to one end of a
cylinder of wood, about two inches and a half in diameter,
and six inches long, fix a small wooden cylinder about three
quarters of an inch in diameter, and three inches long, rounded
at both ends&mdash;the other end of the larger cylinder is also
to be rounded. Cover the whole with tinfoil, and mount it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
on a stand on a glass rod. When used, it is to be placed
with the even piece in a line even with, and about half an
inch from the bottle, and it should be of such a height as to
come just below the silk apron. When it is wished to charge
a Leyden jar, it is to be placed at the round end of the conductor.
By these simple means a great variety of pleasing
experiments may be performed; but to show the various
phenomena connected with this interesting study, we shall
now describe an electrical machine of the newest construction,
and perform our experiments with it.</p>


<p class="p6">THE PLATE ELECTRICAL MACHINE.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 182px;">
<img src="images/i_129.jpg" width="182" height="213" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Formerly the electrical machine was
made in the form of a cylinder, but now
it consists of a plate <span class="smcapa">A</span>, as seen in the
engraving. The plate is turned by the
handle <span class="smcapa">F</span>, through the rubber <span class="smcapa">B B</span>, which
diffuses the excitement over the glass.
The points or balls at each side of the
plate carry off a constant stream of
positive electricity to the prime conductor
<span class="smcapa">C</span>. Negative electricity is generated
by insulating the conductor to
which the cushion is attached, and continuing the prime
conductor with the ground, so as to carry off the fluid collected
from the plate.</p>


<p class="p6">HOW TO DRAW SPARKS FROM THE TIP OF THE NOSE.</p>

<p>If the person who works the machine be supported on a
stool having glass legs, and connected with the conductor
by means of a glass rod, the electricity will pass from the
conductor to him, and as it cannot get away, owing to the
glass on which he stands being a non-conductor, any person
on touching him can draw the electricity from him, which
will exhibit itself in small sparks as it passes to the person
who touches him. If touched on the nose, sparks of fire
will issue from it.</p>

<p class="p6">HOW TO GET A JAR FULL OF ELECTRICITY.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 131px;">
<img src="images/i_130a.jpg" width="131" height="208" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A most useful piece of electrical apparatus is called the
Leyden jar, here represented. It is employed for the purpose
of obtaining a quantity of electricity, which may be
applied to any substance. It consists of a glass jar, coated
both inside and without, four fifths of the
way up, with tinfoil. A knob rises through
a wooden top, communicating with the inside
of the jar. When it is wished to charge
the jar, this knob is applied to the prime conductor
of the electrical machine when in
action, and a quantity of electricity being
given off, the jar will remain charged with
it till a connection is made, by some good
conductor of electricity, between the knob
and the outside tinfoil. A piece of brass
chain must hang from the stem that carries the knob, and
connect it with the interior of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ja'">jar</ins>.</p>


<p class="p6">THE ELECTRICAL BATTERY.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/i_130b.jpg" width="233" height="321" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If several of these jars be united, an enormous quantity
of electricity can be collected; but in arranging them, all
the interior coatings must be made to communicate by metallic
rods, and a similar union must be effected among the
exterior coatings. When thus
arranged, the whole series may
be charged as if they formed but
one jar.</p>

<p>For the purpose of making a
direct communication between
the inner or outer coatings of a jar
or battery, by which a discharge
is effected, an instrument called
a discharging rod is employed.
It consists of two bent metallic
rods, terminating at one end by
brass balls, and connected at
another by a joint which is fixed
to the end of a glass handle, and
which, acting like a pair of compasses,
allows of the balls being
separated at certain distances. When opened to the
proper degree, one of the balls is made to touch the exterior
coating, and the other ball is then brought into contact
with the knob of the jar, when a discharge is effected;
while the glass handle secures the person holding it from
the effects of the shock.</p>

<p class="p6">DANCING BALLS AND DOLLS.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 198px;">
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="198" height="365" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Get two round pieces of wood, <span class="smcapa">A B</span>, and coat them with
tin foil, or two pieces of metal plate; attach one of them to
the prime conductor by a chain, and
let it hang about two or three inches
from the knob. Place some pith balls
upon the bottom piece of wood <span class="smcapa">B</span>, and
bring it under the other. Immediately
this is done, and the upper
piece is charged by electricity from
the machine, the pith balls will jump
up and down, and from one to the
other with great rapidity. If some
of the pith be formed into little figures,
they will also dance and leap about in
the most grotesque manner. The
same may be made to dance by merely
holding the inside of a dry glass tumbler
to the prime conductor for a few
minutes, while the machine is in action,
and then whelming it over them,
when they will jump about to the no
small astonishment of the spectators, as the cause of their
motion is not quite so apparent.</p>


<p class="p6">THE ELECTRICAL KISS.</p>

<p>This amusing experiment is performed by means of the
electrical stool. Let any lady challenge a gentleman not acquainted
with the experiment, to favor her with a salute.
The lady thereupon mounts the glass stool, and takes hold
of a chain connected with the prime conductor. The machine
being then put in motion, the gentleman approaches the
lady, and immediately he attempts to imprint the seal of
soft affection upon her coral lips, a spark will fly in his face,
which generally deters him from his rash and wicked intention.</p>


<p class="p6">RINGING BELLS.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 218px;">
<img src="images/i_132a.jpg" width="218" height="196" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Bells may be made to ring by electricity in the following
manner. Let three small bells be suspended from a brass
wire <span class="smcapa">D D</span>, and supported by a glass pillar <span class="smcapa">A</span>, passing through
bell <span class="smcapa">B</span> to the bell <span class="smcapa">E</span>. The electrical apparatus being attached
to the knob <span class="smcapa">F</span> the electricity passes down the wires <span class="smcapa">D</span> <span class="smcapa">D</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to the bells, which are then positively
electrified, and attract the
clappers <span class="smcapa">C</span> <span class="smcapa">C</span>, that are negatively
so, in consequence of being insulated
by the silken strings, which
are not conductors. The bells
therefore attract the clappers till
they are charged, when they strike
against the center bell to discharge
themselves, and thus a
peal is rung on the bells until the electricity is driven off.</p>

<p>This may be shown in a variety of ways. The subjoined
machine will exhibit the principle upon which many ingenious
toys may be made by the young philosopher. In the
figure <span class="smcapa">A</span> is a wooden board or stand, <span class="smcapa">B B B B</span>, four pillars
having fine wires, <span class="smcapa">C</span> <span class="smcapa">C</span>, stretched

wire or wheel <span class="smcapa">F</span>, having its points
turned the reverse way. By
means of a chain attached to the conductor, and to the instrument
at <span class="smcapa">B</span>, the electricity passes over the pillar <span class="smcapa">B</span>, up
the wire <span class="smcapa">C</span> into the wheel, and off at the points, which causes
it to be turned round on an inclined plane till it reaches
the top.</p>

<p class="p6">IMITATION THUNDERCLOUDS.</p>

<p>To show the manner in which thunderclouds perform their

and made to communicate by means of thin wires,
<span class="smcapa">F</span> and <span class="smcapa">G</span>, one with the <em>inside</em>, and the other with the outside
of a charged jar, <span class="smcapa">D</span>. Now, by pulling the loop of the silk
line <span class="smcapa">E</span>, the cloud 1 will be brought near the cloud 2; continue
this slowly until the clouds (which are furnished with two
small brass balls) are within an inch of each other, when a
beautiful flash, strongly resembling lightning in miniature,
will pass from one cloud to the other, restoring electrical
equilibrium.</p>

<p class="p6">THE SPORTSMAN.</p>

<p>This apparatus is capable of affording much amusement:
<span class="smcapa">A</span> is a stand of wood, <span class="smcapa">B</span> is a common Leyden jar, out of
which proceed the wires <span class="smcapa">H</span> <span class="smcapa">H</span>, one terminating in ball <span class="smcapa">F</span>, the
other in the ball <span class="smcapa">D</span>, to which are attached a number of pith
birds, by silken strings; <span class="smcapa">E</span> is a shelf for the birds to rest
upon; <span class="smcapa">C</span> is the sportsman; <span class="smcapa">G</span> his gun.</p>

<p>To put this operation in motion, the Leyden jar is to be
charged with electricity, by affixing a chain to the bottom
part of it, and connecting it with an electrical machine in
the usual manner, or by applying it to a prime conductor,
when the birds will fly off the knob to which they are fixed,
in consequence of their being repelled. If the sportsman
and gun be then turned, so that the end of his gun shall
touch the knob <span class="smcapa">F</span>, an electric spark will pass from one to
the other, a report will be heard, and the birds will fall
down as if shot, in consequence of the electricity having
been taken from the Leyden jar. There should be a communication
between the sportsman and the jar, formed of
tinfoil, or some metal, as shown by the dotted line on the
stand.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="EXPERIMENTS_IN_GALVANISM" id="EXPERIMENTS_IN_GALVANISM"></a>EXPERIMENTS IN GALVANISM.</h2>


<p>1. Place a thin plate of zinc upon the upper surface of the
tongue, and a half dollar or a piece of silver on the under
surface. Allow the metals to remain for a little time in contact
with the tongue before they are made to touch each
other, that the taste of the metals themselves may not be
confounded with the sensation produced by their contact.
When the edges of the metals, which project beyond the
tongue, are then suffered to touch, a galvanic sensation is
produced, which it is difficult accurately to describe.</p>

<p>2. Place a silver teaspoon as high as possible between
the gums and the upper lip, and a piece of zinc between the
gums and the under lip. On bringing the extremities of the
metals into contact, a very vivid sensation, and an effect like
a flash of light across the eyes, will be perceived. It is singular
that this light is equally vivid in the dark and in the
strongest light, and whether the eyes be shut or open.</p>

<p>3. Put a silver cup or mug, filled with water, upon a plate
of zinc on a table, and just touch the water with the tip of
the tongue; it will be tasteless so long as the zinc plate is
not handled, for the body does not form a voltaic circle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the metals. Moisten your hand well, take hold of the plate
of zinc, and touch the water with your tongue, when a very
peculiar sensation, and an acid taste, will be experienced.</p>

<p>4. Take a piece of copper of about six inches in width,
and put upon it a piece of zinc of rather smaller dimensions,
inserting a piece of cloth, of the same size as the zinc, between
them; place a leech upon the piece of zinc, and though
there appear nothing to hinder it from crawling away, yet
it will not pass from the zinc to the copper, because its damp
body acting as a conductor to the fluid disturbed, as soon as
it touches the copper it receives a galvanic shock, and of
course retires to its resting-place.</p>

<p>5. Plunge an iron knife into a solution of sulphate of copper
(blue-stone); by chemical action, only, it will become
covered with metallic copper. Immerse in the same solution
a piece of platinum, taking care not to let it touch the iron,
and no deposition of copper will take place upon it; but if
the upper ends of the metals be brought into contact with
each other, a copious deposition of copper will soon settle
upon the platinum likewise.</p>


<p class="p6">WITH METAL PLATES IN WATER.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 181px;">
<img src="images/i_136.jpg" width="181" height="187" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If we take two plates of different kinds of metal, platinum
or copper, and zinc, for example, and immerse them in pure
water, having wires attached to them
above, then if the wire of each is brought
into contact in another vessel of water,
a galvanic circle will be formed, the
water will be slowly decomposed, its
oxygen will be fixed on the zinc wire,
and at the same time a current of electricity
will be transmitted through the
liquid to the platinum or copper wire, on
the end of which the other element of
water, namely, the hydrogen, will make its appearance in the
form of minute gas bubbles. The electrical current passes
back again into the zinc at the points of its contact with the
platinum, and thus a continued current is kept up, and hence
it is called a galvanic circle. The moment the circuit is
broken by separating the wires, the current ceases, but is
again renewed by making them touch either in or out of the
water. If a small quantity of sulphuric acid be added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the water, the phenomenon will be more apparent. The end
of the wire attached to the piece of platinum or copper is
called the positive pole of the battery, and that of the wire
attached to the zinc is the negative pole.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="500" height="98" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The current of electricity here generated will be extremely
feeble, but this can be easily increased by multiplying the
glasses and the number of the pieces of metal. If we take
six such glasses instead of one, partially fill them with dilute
sulphuric acid, and put a piece of zinc and copper into each,
connecting them by means of copper wire from glass to
glass through the whole series, a stronger current of electricity
will be the result. The experimenter must be careful
not to let the wire and zinc touch each other at the bottom
of the tumblers, and must also remember that the copper of
glass 1 is connected with the zinc of glass 2, and so on.</p>


<p class="p6">TO MAKE A MAGNET BY GALVANISM.</p>

<p>To effect this, make a connection between the poles of the
above or any excited battery with the two ends of a wire
formed into a spiral coil, by bending common bonnet wire
closely round a cylinder, or tube, of about an inch in diameter;
into this coil introduce a needle, or piece of steel
wire, laying it lengthways down the circles of the coil. In
a few minutes after the electric fluid has passed through the
spiral wire, and consequently round the needle or wire, the
latter will be found to be strongly magnetized, and to possess
all the properties of a magnet.</p>


<p class="p6">EFFECTS OF GALVANISM ON A MAGNET.</p>

<p>If a galvanic current, or any electric current, be made to
pass along a wire, under which and in a line with it a compass
is placed, it will be found that the needle will no longer
point north and south, but will take a direction nearly across
the current, and point almost east and west.</p>


<p class="p6">CHANGE OF COLOR BY GALVANISM.</p>

<p>Put a teaspoonful of sulphate of soda into a cup, and
dissolve it in hot water; pour a little cabbage blue into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
solution, and put a portion into two glasses, connecting
them by a piece of linen or cotton cloth previously moistened
in the same solution. On putting one of the wires of the
galvanic pole into each glass, the acid accumulates in the
one, turning the blue to a red, and the alkali in the other,
rendering it green. If the wires be now reversed, the acid
accumulates eventually in the glass where the alkali appeared,
while the alkali passes to the glass where the acid was.</p>


<p class="p6">THE GALVANIC SHOCK.</p>

<p>If the ends of the wires of a galvanic battery be placed
in separate basins of water, then, on dipping the fingers of
each hand in the basin, a smart shock will be felt, with a
particular aching accompanied with trembling. With a
strong battery this effect is felt as high as the shoulders.
The shock will also be felt by simply holding the galvanic
wires, one in each hand, provided the hands be moistened
with salt and water. Several persons may receive the shock
together by joining hands.</p>


<p class="p6">FAMILIAR GALVANIC EFFECTS.</p>

<p>Coat the point of your tongue with tin-foil, and its middle
part with gold or silver leaf, so that the two metals touch,
when a sourish taste will be produced. This simple effect is
termed "A Galvanic Tongue."</p>

<p>Ale and porter drink better out of a pewter or tin pot,
than from glass or earthenware; because of the galvanic
influence of the green copper as used to give the beer a
frothy head.</p>

<p>Galvanic experiments may be made with the legs of a
frog. A live flounder will answer nearly the same purpose.
Lay the fish in a plate, upon a slip of zinc, to which is attached
a piece of wire, and put a quarter dollar upon the
flounder's back; then touch the quarter dollar with the wire,
and at each contact strong muscular contractions will be

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="EXPERIMENTS_IN_MAGNETISM" id="EXPERIMENTS_IN_MAGNETISM"></a>EXPERIMENTS IN MAGNETISM.</h2>


<p>1. We have said that the agency of the magnet can be
imparted to hard metallic bodies; this may be done in a very
easy way. If you pass a magnet (which may be either
natural or artificial) over a sewing-needle several times
from the eye to the point, the needle will acquire the principle,
and attract iron filings in the same manner as a natural
magnet would do. But the part of the magnet which
you apply to the needle must be the north pole; and you
must not pass it over the needle backward and forward, but
lift it always from the point and again begin from the eye.
Suppose you wish to impart the principle to a small bar of
tempered steel, tie the piece to be magnetized to a poker
with a piece of silk, and hold the part of the poker to which
it is attached in the left hand; take hold of the tongs, a
little below the middle, with the right hand, and rub the
steel bar with them, moving the tongs from the bottom
to the top, and keeping them steadily in a vertical position
all the time. About a dozen strokes on each side will impart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sufficient magnetic power to the bar to enable the
operator to lift up small pieces of iron and steel with it.
The lower end of the bar should be marked before it is fastened
to the poker, so that the poles may be readily distinguished
from each other when it is taken off; the upper end
being the south pole, and the lower the north.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 205px;">
<img src="images/i_140.jpg" width="205" height="120" alt="" />
</div>

<p>2. Scatter some iron filings upon
a piece of paper, and hold a magnet
underneath it. The instant
the contact takes place, the filings
will raise themselves upright, and
fall down as soon as the magnet is
withdrawn. The effect is singular,
and indeed very amusing; the diminutive iron particles
rising and falling, as if by supernatural agency.</p>


<p class="p6">TEST OF MAGNETIC POWER.</p>

<p>To ascertain whether a piece of metal, or mineral, is magnetic,
present it to one of the poles of a poised magnet. If
it be attracted at both poles, you may then conclude that
the substance so tested is not magnetic.</p>

<p>Dip a magnet into boiling water, and it will lose half of
its magnetism; but as the magnet cools, its full power will
return.</p>


<p class="p6">TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS.</p>

<p>This may be done by stroking a piece of hard steel with a
natural or artificial magnet. Take a common sewing-needle,
and pass the north pole of a magnet from the eye to the
point, pressing it gently in so doing. After reaching the
end of the needle, the magnet must not be passed back again
towards the eye, but must be lifted up and applied again to
that end, the friction being always in the same direction.
After repeating this for a few times, the needle will become
magnetized, and attract iron filings, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="p6">HOW TO MAGNETIZE A POKER.</p>

<p>Hold it in the left hand in a position slightly inclined from
the perpendicular, the lower end pointing to the north, and
then strike it smartly several times with a large iron hammer,
and it will be found to possess the powers of a magnet,
although but slightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">TO SHOW MAGNETIC REPULSION AND ATTRACTION.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 163px;">
<img src="images/i_141.jpg" width="163" height="218" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Suspend two short pieces of iron wire, <span class="smcapa">N S</span>, <span class="smcapa">N S</span>, so that
they will hang in contact in a vertical
position. If the north pole of a magnet
<span class="smcapa">N</span> be now brought to a moderate distance
between the wires, they will recede from
each other as in figure 1.</p>

<p>The ends <span class="smcapa">S</span> <span class="smcapa">S</span> being made south poles
by induction from the north pole <span class="smcapa">N</span>, will
repel each other, and so will the north
poles <span class="smcapa">N</span> <span class="smcapa">N</span>. This separation of the wires
will increase as the magnet approaches
them, but there will be a particular distance
at which the attractive force of <span class="smcapa">N</span>
overcomes the repulsive force of the poles <span class="smcapa">S</span> <span class="smcapa">S</span>, and causes
the wires to converge as in figure 2; the north poles <span class="smcapa">N</span> <span class="smcapa">N</span>
still exhibiting their mutual repulsion.</p>


<p class="p6">VARIATION OF THE NEEDLE.</p>

<p>The magnetic needle does not point exactly north and
south, but the north pole of the needle takes a direction considerably
to the west of the true north. It is constantly
changing, and varies at different parts of the earth, and at
different times of the day.</p>


<p class="p6">DIP OF THE NEEDLE.</p>

<p>Another remarkable and evident manifestation of the
influence of the magnetism of the earth upon the needle is
the inclination or dip of the latter, which is a deviation from
its horizontal place in a downward direction in northern regions
of its north, and in southern regions of its south pole.
The causes of the dipping of the needle are yet unexplained.
In balancing the needle on the crd, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'aon'">on</ins> account of this dipping,
a small weight or moveable piece of brass is placed
on one end of the needle, by the shifting of which either
nearer to or further from the center, the needle will always
be balanced.</p>


<p class="p6">TO SUSPEND A NEEDLE IN THE AIR BY MAGNETISM.</p>

<p>Place a magnet on a stand to raise it a little above the
table; then bring a small sewing-needle containing a thread,
within a little distance of the magnet, keeping hold of the
thread to prevent the needle from attaching itself to the magnet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
The needle in endeavoring to fly to the magnet, and
being prevented by the thread, will remain curiously suspended
in the air, like Mahommed's coffin.</p>


<p class="p6">MAGNETISM BY HAMMERING.</p>

<p>Place a bar of iron in a vertical position, and give it a
series of slight blows with a hammer or poker, when it will
acquire a feeble degree of magnetism; hence it happens,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thst'">that</ins> the anvils and other tools employed in smithies are
endowed with magnetism.</p>

<p>It is, however, a remarkable circumstance, that if you
strike a magnet its magnetizing force will be either very
much impaired, or altogether destroyed.</p>

<p>Percussion and friction in the required position would
seem, from this and preceding experiments, to be the chief
means of magnetizing iron and steel. These operations, as
it were, waken up the inert particles of the metal to admit
new magnetism, or to develop that which already resides in
it, originally derived from the earth.</p>


<p class="p6">POWER OF THE ELECTRO MAGNET.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/i_142.jpg" width="80" height="220" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The same influence which affects the magnetic needle
already described, will also communicate magnetism
to soft iron. If a bar of that metal, bent as in
the drawing, be surrounded with a common bonnet
wire, or a copper wire prevented from touching
the iron by a winding of cotton or thread, and
then if a current of voltaic electricity be sent
through the wire, the bar becomes a powerful
magnet, and will continue so as long as the connection
with the battery is preserved. On breaking
the contact, the magnetism disappears. This
experiment may be easily made by the young
reader with a horse-shoe magnet, surrounded by
several coils of wire. <span class="smcapa">P</span> is the positive and <span class="smcapa">N</span> the negative
pole.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MARINER'S COMPASS.</p>

<p>The mariner's compass is an artificial magnet fitted in a
proper box, and consists of three parts&mdash;1, the box; 2, the
card or fly; and 3, the needle. The box is suspended in a
square wooden case, by means of two concentric brass
circles called gimbals, so fixed by brazen axes to the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
boxes, that the inner one, or compass-box, retains a horizontal
position in all motions of the ship. The card is a circular
piece of paper which is fastened upon the needle, and
moves with it. The outer edge of the card is divided into
thirty-two points, as shown in the engraving, called points
of the compass. The needle is a slender bar of hardened
steel, having a hollow agate cup in the center, which moves
upon the point of a pivot made of brass.</p>

<p class="p6">TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS WITHOUT THE AID EITHER OF NATURAL
LOADSTONES OR ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 177px;">
<img src="images/i_143b.jpg" width="177" height="279" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Take an iron poker and tongs, or two bars of iron, the
larger and the older the better, and fixing the poker upright,
hold to it with the left hand near the top <span class="smcapa">P</span> by a silk thread,
a bar of soft steel about three inches long, one fourth of
an inch broad, and one twentieth thick;
mark one end, and let this end be
downwards. Then grasping the tongs
<span class="smcapa">T</span> with the right hand a little below
the middle, and keeping them nearly
in a vertical line, let the bar <span class="smcapa">B</span> be rubbed
with the lower end <span class="smcapa">L</span> of the tongs,
from the marked end of the bar to its
upper end, about ten times on each side
of it. By this means the bar <span class="smcapa">B</span> will
receive as much magnetism as will
enable it to lift a small key at the
marked end; and this end, the bar
being suspended by its middle or made
to rest on a joint, will turn to the
north, and is called its north pole, the unmarked end being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the south pole. This is the method recommended by Mr. Caxton,
in his process, which he regarded superior to those in
former use, and of which a more detailed account will be
found in his interesting volume.</p>


<p class="p6">THE WATCH MAGNETIZED.</p>

<p>Borrow a watch from the company, and inquire if it will
go when laid on the table. Then place it just over the
point at which a magnet is fixed underneath the top of the
table, and the magnet will attract the balance-wheel of the
watch, and cause it to stop.</p>


<p class="p6">NORTH AND SOUTH POLES OF THE MAGNET.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/i_144a.jpg" width="101" height="155" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Each magnet has its poles, north and south,
the north or south poles of one magnet, repel
the north and south pole of another. If a
magnet, as in the following figure, be dipped
in some iron filings, they will be immediately
attracted to one end. Supposing this to be
the north pole, each of the ends of the filings,
not in contact with the magnet, will become
north poles, while the ends in contact will by
induction become south poles. Both will have a tendency
to repel each other, and the filings will stand on the magnet
as in the figure.</p>


<p class="p6">POLARITY OF THE MAGNET.</p>

<p>The best method of proving this is to take a magnet or a
piece of steel rendered magnetic, and to place it on a piece
of cork by laying it in a groove cut to receive it. If the
cork be placed in the center of a basin of water, and allowed
to swim freely on its surface, so that it is not attracted by
the sides of the basin, it will be
found to turn its north pole to the
north, and its south pole to the south,
the same as the mariner's compass.
If you fix two magnets in two pieces
of cork, and place them also in a
basin of water, and they are in a parallel position with the
same poles together, that is, north to north, and south to
south, they will mutually repel each other; but if the contrary
poles point to one another, as north to south, they will
be attracted.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 185px;">
<img src="images/i_144b.jpg" width="185" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">MAGNETIC ACTION AND REACTION.</p>

<p>A magnet and a piece of iron attract each other equally,
whatever disproportion there is between their sizes. If
either be balanced in a scale, and the other be brought within
a certain distance beneath it, the very same counterpoise
will be required to prevent their approach, whichever be in
the scale. If the two were hanging near each other, as
pendulums, they would approach and meet, but the little
one would perform more of the journey in proportion to its
littleness.</p>


<p class="p6">TO PASS MAGNETISM THROUGH A BOARD.</p>

<p>Place a common sewing-needle on a smooth horizontal
board, and move a strong magnet underneath the board,
when the needle will revolve along the board, according to
the peculiar motion given to the magnet.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MAGNETIC TABLE.</p>

<p>Under the top of a common table, place a magnet that
turns on a pivot, and fix a board under it that nothing may
appear. There may also be a drawer under the table,
which you pull out, to show that there is nothing concealed.
At one end of the table there must be a pin that communicates
with a magnet, and by which it may be placed in
different positions; this pin must be so placed as not to be
visible to the spectators. Strew some steel filings, or very
small nails, over that part of the table where the magnet
is. Then ask any one to lend a knife, or a key, which will
then attract part of the nails or filings. Then placing your
hand, in a careless manner, on the pin at the end of the
table, you alter the position of the magnet; and giving the
key to any person, you desire him to make the experiment,
which he will then not be able to perform. You then give
the key to another person, at the same time placing the
magnet, by means of the pin, in the first position, when
that person will immediately perform the experiment.</p>


<p class="p6">INTERESTING PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE MAGNET.</p>

<p>Fire-irons which have rested in one position in a room
during the summer months are often highly magnetic.</p>

<p>Iron bars standing erect, such as the gratings of a prison
cell, or the iron railings before houses, are often magnetic.</p>

<p>The uppermost of the iron tires round a carriage wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
attracts the north end of a magnet, and has hence south
polarity, while the lower end attracting the south end of
the same, has north polarity.</p>


<p class="p6a">CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>The preceding experiments in Electricity, Galvanism, and
Magnetism, we have selected for the simple yet clear expositions
which they offer of the fundamental principles of
those branches of philosophy; more elaborate experiments
we have refrained from inserting, as although, perhaps,
more astonishing and impressive in their effects, the costly
and cumbrous apparatus which they require, raise them far
above the means of most boys, for whose instruction and
amusement we cater.</p>


<p class="p6">EXAGGERATED MAGNETISM.</p>

<p>Our readers will, doubtless, recollect several stories, in
which the powers of the magnet are greatly exaggerated.
Other accounts of its virtues, though true in fact, yet really
appear, without some consideration, to be fictitious.</p>

<p>In a German collection of fairy tales, in which the ancient
chivalry of the court of the famous Charlemagne, the faithful
squires who attended on his heroic knights, the damsels
in distress whom they relieved, the dwarfs who were their
friends, and the giants and magicians who "worked their
earthly woe," are the principal characters, we remember a
passage to the effect following: "The knight, who volunteered
to adventure forward from the body of cavalry that
were bent on this exploit, to reconnoitre the position of this
gigantic enchanter's castle, had scarcely approached within
sight of it, when he beheld the enormous bulk of the giant
himself leaning against the outward wall. Pursuant to
the instructions he had received, the knight, forthwith,
turned his gallant steed's head towards his companions in
arms, and, at a swift pace, came pricking o'er the plain.
He now heard the giant in pursuit, and struck his spurs
into his good steed's flank; but, alas! he had scarcely approached
within view of the chivalric troop, when the
mighty hand of the giant magician was stretched forth,
armed only with one of his horse's shoes, which was made
of loadstone, and, by its attractive powers on his steel
armor, his grieved associates had the mortification of seeing
the knight unhorsed."</p>

<p>The branch of the physical sciences which relates to the
air and its various phenomena is called Pneumatics. By it
we learn many curious particulars. By it we find that
the air has weight and pressure, color, density, elasticity,
compressibility, and some other properties with which we
shall endeavor to make the young reader acquainted by
many pleasing experiments, earnestly impressing upon him
to lose no opportunity of making physical science his study.</p>

<p>To show that the air has weight and pressure, the common
leather sucker by which boys raise stones will show
the pressure of the atmosphere. It consists of a piece of
soft but firm leather, having a piece of string drawn through
its center. The leather is made quite wet and pliable, and
then its under part is placed on the stone and stamped down
by the foot. This pressing of the leather excludes the air
from between the leather and the stone, and by pulling the
string a vacuum is left underneath its center; consequently
the weight of the air about the edges of the leather, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
being counterbalanced by any air between it and the stone,
enables the boy to lift it.</p>


<p class="p6">WEIGHT OF THE AIR PROVED BY A PAIR OF BELLOWS.</p>

<p>Shut the nozzle and valve-hole of a pair of bellows, and
after having squeezed the air out of them, if they are perfectly
air-tight, we shall find that a very great force, even
some hundreds of pounds, is necessary for separating the
boards. They are kept together by the weight of the heavy
air which surrounds them in the same manner as if they
were surrounded by water.</p>


<p class="p6">THE PRESSURE OF THE AIR SHOWN BY A WINE-GLASS.</p>

<p>Place a card on a wine-glass filled with water, then invert
the glass, the water will not escape, the pressure of the atmosphere
on the outside of the card being sufficient to support
the water.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 156px;">
<img src="images/i_148b.jpg" width="156" height="152" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Invert a tall glass jar in a dish of water, and place a
lighted taper under it; as the taper consumes the air in the
jar, the water from the pressure without
<em>rises up</em> to supply the place of the air removed
by the combustion. In the operation
of cupping, the operator holds the
flame of a lamp under a bell-shaped glass.
The air within this being rarefied and expanded,
a considerable portion is given off.
In this state the glass is placed upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
flesh, and as the air within it cools, it contracts, and the glass
adheres to the flesh by the difference of the pressure of the
internal and external air.</p>


<p class="p6">ELASTICITY OF THE AIR.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 145px;">
<img src="images/i_149a.jpg" width="145" height="241" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This can be shown by a beautiful philosophical toy which
may easily be constructed. Procure a glass jar, such as is
here represented. Then mould three or four little figures in
wax, and make them hollow within, and having each a minute
opening at the heel, by which water may pass in and
out. Place them in the jar, as seen in the figure, and adjust
them by the quantity of water admitted to them, so that
in specific gravity they differ a little from each other. The
mouth of the jar should now be covered
with a piece of skin or India-rubber, and
then, if the hand be pressed upon the top
or mouth of the jar, the figures will be seen
to rise or descend as the pressure is gentle
or heavy, rising and falling, or standing
still, according to the pressure made.</p>


<p class="p6">REASON FOR THIS.</p>

<p>The reason of this is, that the pressure
on the top of the jar condenses the air between
the cover and the water surface;
this condensation then presses on the water
below, and influences it through its whole extent, compressing
also the air in the figures, forcing as much more water
into them as to render them heavier than water, and therefore
heavy enough to sink.</p>


<p class="p6">THE AIR-PUMP.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 178px;">
<img src="images/i_149b.jpg" width="178" height="194" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The time was, and that not very long ago, when the air-pump
was only obtainable by the philosophical
professor, or by persons of
enlarged means. But now, owing to
our "cheap way of doing things," a
small air-pump may be obtained for
about five or six dollars, and we would
strongly advise our young friend to
procure one, as it will be a source of
endless amusement to him; and, supposing
that he takes our advice, we
give him the following experiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The air-pump consists of a bell glass, called the receiver,
<span class="smcapa">A</span>, and a stand, upon which is a perforated plate <span class="smcapa">B</span>. The hole
in this plate is connected with two pistons, the rods of which
are moved by a wheel handle backwards and forwards, and
thus pump the air out of the receiver. When the air is taken
out, a stop-cock is turned, and then the experiments may be
performed.</p>

<p>Under the receiver of an air-pump, when the air has been
thoroughly exhausted, light and heavy bodies fall with the
same swiftness. Animals quickly die for want of air, combustion
ceases, gunpowder will not explode, a bell sounds
faint, magnets are powerless, and waters and other fluids turn
to vapor.</p>


<p class="p6">TO PROVE THAT AIR HAS WEIGHT.</p>

<p>Take a florence flask, fitted up with a screw and fine oiled
silk valve. Screw the flask on the plate of the air-pump,
exhaust the air, take it off the plate and weigh it. Then let
in the air, and again weigh the whole, and it will be found
to have increased by several grains.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_150.jpg" width="400" height="208" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="p6">TO PROVE AIR ELASTIC.</p>

<p>Place a bladder, out of which all the air has apparently
been squeezed, under the receiver, upon it lay a weight, exhaust
the air, and it will be seen that the small quantity of
air left within the bladder will so expand itself as to lift the
weight. Put a corked bottle into the receiver, exhaust the
air, and the cork will fly out.</p>


<p class="p6">AIR IN THE EGG.</p>

<p>Take a fresh egg and cut off a little of the shell and film
from its smaller end, then put the egg under a receiver and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
pump out the air, upon which all the contents of the egg
will be forced out by the expansion of the small bubble of
air contained in the great end between the shell and the
film.</p>

<p class="p6">THE DESCENDING SMOKE.</p>

<p>Set a lighted candle on a plate, and cover it with a tall
receiver. The candle will continue to burn while the air
remains, but when exhausted, will go out, and the smoke
from the wick, instead of rising, will descend in dense clouds
towards the bottom of the glass, because the air which
would have supported it has been withdrawn.</p>

<p>Place a nicely-adjusted pair of forceps
at the top of the receiver, communicating
with the top at the outside
through a hole, so that they may be
opened by the fingers. Then place on
each of the little plates a <em>half-eagle</em> and
a <em>feather</em>. Exhaust the air from the receiver,
and having done so, detach the
objects, so that they may fall. In the
open air the half-eagle will fall long before
the feather, but in vacuo, as in the
receiver now exhausted of its air, they
will fall both together, and reach the bottom of the glass at
same instant.</p>


<p class="p6">THE SOUNDLESS BELL.</p>

<p>Set a bell on the pump-plate, having a contrivance so as
to ring it at pleasure, and cover it with a receiver, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
make the clapper sound against the bell, and it will be
heard to sound very well; now exhaust the receiver of air,
and then, when the clapper strikes against the sides of the
bell, the sound can be scarcely heard.</p>

</div>


<p class="p6">THE FLOATING FISH.</p>

<p>If a glass vessel, containing water, in which a couple of
fish are put be placed under the receiver, upon exhausting
the air, the fish will be unable to keep at the bottom of the
glass, owing to the expansion of the air within their bodies,
contained in the air bladder. They will consequently rise
and float, belly upwards, upon the surface of the water.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MYSTERIOUS CIRCLES.</p>

<p>Cut from a card two discs or circular pieces, about two
inches in diameter. In the center of one of them make a
hole, into which put the tube of a common quill, one end
being even with the surface of the card. Make the other
piece a little convex, and lay its center over the end of the
quill, with the concave side of the card downwards, the
center of the upper card being from one eighth to one fourth
of an inch above the end of the quill&mdash;attempt to blow off
the upper card by blowing through the quill, and <em>it will be
found impossible</em>.</p>

<p>If, however, the edges of the two cards be made to fit
each other very accurately, the upper card will move, and
sometimes it will be thrown off; but when the edges of the
cards are, on two sides, sufficiently far apart to permit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
air to escape, the loose card will retain its position, even
when the current of air sent against it be strong. The experiment
will succeed equally well, whether the current of
air be made from the mouth or from a pair of bellows.
When the quill fits the card rather loosely, a comparatively
light puff will throw both cards three or four feet in height.
When, from the humidity of the breath, the upper surface
of the perforated card has a little expanded, and the two
opposite sides are somewhat depressed, those depressed
sides may be seen distinctly to rise and approach the upper
card, directly in proportion to the force of the current of air.</p>

<p>Another fact to be shown with this simple apparatus appears
equally inexplicable with the former. Lay the loose
card upon the hand with the concave side up; blow forcibly
through the tube, and, at the same time, bring the two
cards towards each other; when within three eighths of an
inch, if the current of air be strong, the loose card will suddenly
rise, and adhere to the perforated card. If the card
through which the quill passes has several holes made in it,
the loose card may be instantly thrown off with the least
puff of air.</p>

<p>For the explanation of the above phenomenon, a gold
medal and one hundred guineas were offered, some years
since, by the Royal Society. Such explanation has been
given by Dr. Robert Hare, late of the University of Pennsylvania,
and is as follows:</p>

<p>Supposing the diameters of the discs of card to be to that
of the hole as 8 to 1, the area of the former to the latter
must be as 64 to 1. Hence, if the discs were to be separated
(their surfaces remaining parallel) with a velocity as
great as that of the air blast, a column of air must, meantime,
be interposed, 64 times greater than that which would
escape from the tube during the interim; consequently, if
all the air necessary to preserve the balance be supplied
from the tube, the discs must be separated with a velocity
as much less than that of the blast, as the column required
between them is greater than that yielded by the tube; and
yet the air cannot be supplied from any other source, unless
a deficit of pressure be created between the discs, unfavorable
to their separation.</p>

<p>It follows, then, that, under the circumstances in question,
the discs cannot be made to move asunder with a velocity
greater than one sixty-fourth of that of the blast. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
all the force of the current of air through the tube will be
expended on the moveable disc, and the thin ring of air,
which exists round the orifice between the discs; and since
the moveable discs can only move with one sixty-fourth the
velocity of the blast, the ring of air in the interstice must
experience nearly all the force of the jet, and must be driven
outwards, the blast following it, in various currents radiating
from the common center of the tube and discs.</p>

<p>The diving-bell is a pneumatic engine, by means of which
persons can descend to great depths in the sea, and recover
from it valuable portions of wrecks
and other matters. Its principle may
be well illustrated by the following
experiment. Take a glass tumbler,
and plunge it into the water with the
mouth downwards, and it will be
found that the water will not rise much
more than half way in the tumbler. This may be made
very evident if a piece of cork be suffered to float inside of
the glass on the surface of the water.
The air within the tumbler does not entirely
exclude the water, because air is
elastic, and consequently compressible,
and hence the air in the tumbler is what
is called condensed. The diving-bell is
formed upon the above principle, but
instead of being of glass, it is a wooden
or metal vessel, of very large dimensions,
so as to hold three or four persons,
who are supplied with air from above
by means of a tube, having a corresponding
tube to let off the breathed air, the circulation of which
is kept up by pumps, which pump the air in and draw it out
of the bell.</p>


<p class="p6">THE AIR BALLOON.</p>

<p>The art of sailing or navigating a body through the air is
called aëronautics. In remote ages, Icarus is said to have
risen so high in the air that the sun melted his wings, and
he fell into the Ægean sea, and was drowned; and there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
reason to believe, from some figures that have recently been
discovered on Egyptian and Assyrian monuments, that the
ancients possessed means of rising in the air with which
we are not now acquainted.</p>

<p>The air-balloon, as now constructed, is a bag of silk of
large dimensions, usually cut in gores, and is, when expanded
by gas, of a pear shape. It ascends in the atmosphere
because its whole bulk is much lighter than the air
would be in the space it occupies. It is, in fact, a vessel
filled with a fluid which will float on another fluid lighter
than itself.</p>


<p class="p6">HOW TO MAKE AN AIR-BALLOON.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 140px;">
<img src="images/i_155.jpg" width="140" height="246" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The best shape for an air-balloon, or rather a gas-balloon,
is that of a peg-top. And in preparing the gores proceed
as follows: Get some close texture silk, and cut it into a
form resembling a narrow pear with a very thin stalk.
Fourteen of these pieces will be found to be the best number;
and, of course, the breadths of each piece must be
measured accordingly. When sewing them together, it will
be of advantage to coat the parts that overlap with a layer
of varnish, as this will save much trouble afterwards, and
hold the silk firmer in its place during the stitching. The
threads must be placed very regularly, or the balloon will
be drawn out of shape, and it will be found useful if the
gores are covered with an interior coating of varnish before
they are finally sewn together. Take care not to have the
varnish too thick. To the upper part of the balloon there
should be a valve opening inwards, to which a string should
be fastened, passing through a hole made
in a small piece of wood fixed in the lower
part of the balloon, so that the aëronaut may
open the valve when he wishes to descend;
and this should be imitated on a small
scale, so that the young aëronaut may be
perfectly familiar with the construction of
a balloon. The gores are to be covered
with a varnish of India rubber dissolved
in a mixture of turpentine and naphtha.
Over the whole of the upper part should be
a net-work, which should come down to
the middle, with various cords, proceeding
from it to the circumference of a circle about two feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
below the balloon. The circle may be made of wood, or
of several pieces of slender cane bound together. The
meshes should be small at the top, against which part of
the balloon the inflammable air exerts the greatest force,
and increase in size as they recede from the top.</p>

<p>The car is made of wicker work; it is usually covered
with leather, and is well varnished or painted. It is suspended
by ropes proceeding from the net which goes over
the balloon. Balloons of this kind cannot be made smaller
than six feet in diameter, of oiled silk, as the weight of the
material is too great for the air to buoy it up. They may
be made smaller of thin slips of bladder, or other membrane
glued together, or of thin gutta-percha cloth, which is now
extensively used for this purpose; with this they may be
made a foot in diameter, and will rise beautifully.</p>


<p class="p6">HOW TO FILL A BALLOON.</p>

<p>Procure a large stone bottle which will hold a gallon of
water, into this put a pound of iron filings, or granulated
zinc, with two quarts of water, and add to this by degrees
one pint of sulphuric acid. Then take a tube, either of
glass or metal, and introduce one end of it through a cork,
which place in the bottle, then put the other end into the
neck of the balloon, and the gas will rise into the body of
it. When quite full withdraw the tube, and tie the neck
of the balloon with strong cord very tightly. If freed it
will now rise in the air.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 119px;">
<img src="images/i_156.jpg" width="119" height="78" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Cut the gores, according to the form already given, from
well woven tissue paper, paste the gores nicely together,
and look well over the surface of the paper
for any small hole or slit, over which paste
a piece of paper, and let it dry. Pass a
wire round the neck of the balloon, and
have two cross pieces at its diameter a little
bent, so that a piece of soft cotton dipped in spirits of wine
may be laid on them. When all is prepared let some one
hold the balloon from its top by means of a stick, while you
dip the cotton in spirits of wine till it is thoroughly saturated,
place it under the balloon and set fire to it, but be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
very careful you do not set fire to the balloon.
When the air is sufficiently heated
within, the balloon will indicate a desire
to rise, and when it pulls very hard, let it
go, and it will ascend to a great height in
the air, and at night present a very beautiful
appearance.</p>


<p class="p6">PARACHUTES.</p>

<p>These are easily made by cutting a
piece of paper in a circular form, and placing
threads round the edges, which may be made to converge
to a point, at which a cork may be placed as a
balance. They ascend by the air getting under them, and
are frequently blown to a great distance.</p>

<p class="p6">THE MYSTERIOUS BOTTLE.</p>

<p>Pierce a few holes with a glazier's diamond in a common
black bottle; place it in a vase or jug of water, so that the
neck only is above the surface. Then, with a funnel, fill
the bottle and cork it well, and while it is in the jug or vase.
Take it out, notwithstanding the holes in the bottom, it will
not leak; wipe it dry, and give it to some person to uncork.
The moment the cork is drawn, to the party's astonishment,
the water will begin to run out of the bottom of the bottle.</p>


<p class="p6">CAOUTCHOUC BALLOONS.</p>

<p>Put a little ether into a bottle of caoutchouc, close it
tightly, soak it in hot water, and it will become inflated to
a considerable size. These globes may be made so thin as
to be transparent.</p>

<p>A piece of caoutchouc, the size of a walnut, has thus been
extended to a ball fifteen inches in diameter; and a few
years since a caoutchouc balloon, thus made, escaped from
Philadelphia, and was found one hundred and thirty miles
from that city.</p>

<p>Optics is the science of <em>light</em> and <em>vision</em>. Concerning the
nature of light, two theories are at present very ably maintained
by their respective advocates. One is termed the
Newtonian theory, and the other the Huygenean. The
Newtonian theory considers light to consist of inconceivably
small bodies emanating from the sun, or any other luminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
body. The Huygenean conceives it to consist in the undulations
of a highly elastic and subtle fluid, propagated
round luminous centers in spherical waves, like those arising
in a placid lake when a stone is dropped into the water.</p>


<p class="p6">LIGHT AS AN EFFECT.</p>

<p>Light follows the same laws as gravity, and its intensity
or degree decreases as the square of the distance from the
luminous body increases. Thus, at the distance of two yards
from a candle we shall have four times less light than we
should have, were we only one yard from it, and so on in the
same proportion.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 190px;">
<img src="images/i_159b.jpg" width="190" height="165" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Bodies which suffer the rays of light to pass through
them, such as water or glass, are called refracting media.
When rays of light enter these, they
do not proceed in straight lines, but
are said to be refracted, or bent out
of their course, as seen in the drawing.
The ray of light proceeding
from <span class="smcapa">B</span> through the glass <span class="smcapa">L G</span> is bent
from the point <span class="smcapa">C</span>, instead of passing
in the direction of the dotted line.
But if the ray <span class="smcapa">F C</span> falls perpendicularly
on the glass, there is no refraction, and it proceeds in a
direct line to <span class="smcapa">K</span>; hence refraction only takes place when
rays fall obliquely or aslant on the media.</p>

<p>The prism is a triangular solid of glass, and by it the
young optician may decompose a ray of light into its primitive
and supplementary colors, for a ray of light is of a compound
nature. By the prism the ray
<span class="smcapa">A</span> is divided into its three primitive
colors, blue, red, and yellow; and
their four supplementary ones, violet,
indigo, green, and orange. The best
way to perform this experiment is
to cut a small slit in a window-shutter,
on which the sun shines at some
period of the day, and directly opposite the hole place a
prism <span class="smcapa">P</span>; a beam of light in passing through it will then be
decomposed, and if let fall upon a sheet of white paper, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
against a white wall, the seven colors of the rainbow will be
observed.</p>


<p class="p6">TO MAKE A PRISM.</p>

<p>Provide two small pieces of window-glass and a lump of
wax; soften and mould the wax, stick the two pieces of
glass upon it, so that they meet, as in the cut, where <em>w</em> is

<p>To use the instrument thus made,
make a small hole, or a narrow horizontal

through it, when you stand at some distance from it in the
room; or a piece of pasteboard placed in the upper part of
the window-sash, with a slit cut in it, will serve the purpose
of the hole in the shutter. The slit should be about one
tenth of an inch wide, and an inch or two long, with even
edges. Then hold the prism in your hand, place it close to
your eye, and look through the drop of water, when you will
see a beautiful train of colors, called a spectrum; at one
end red, at the other violet, and in the middle yellowish
green.</p>

better explain the direction in

By a little practice,
you will soon become accustomed
to look in the right
direction, and will see the
colors very bright and distinct.</p>

<p>By means of this simple contrivance white light may be
analyzed, and proved to consist of colored rays, and several
of its properties be beautifully illustrated.</p>


<p class="p6">COMPOSITION OF LIGHT.</p>

<p>The beam of light passing through the prism is decomposed,
and the spaces occupied by the colors are in the following
proportions: red, 6; orange, 4; yellow, 7; green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
8; blue, 8; indigo, 6; violet, 11. Now, if you paste a
sheet of white paper on a circular piece of board about six
inches in diameter, and divide it with
a pencil into fifty parts, and paint
colors in them in the proportions
given above, painting them dark in
the center parts, and gradually fainter
at the edges, till they blend with
the one adjoining; and if the board be
then fixed to an axle, and made to
revolve quickly, the colors will no
longer appear separate and distinct,
but becoming gradually less visible,
they will ultimately appear <em>white</em>, giving this appearance to
the whole surface of the paper.</p>

large room. It consists of a sort of tin box, within which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
is a lamp, the light of which (strongly reflected by the
reflector <span class="smcapa">T</span>,) passes through a great plano-convex lens <span class="smcapa">E</span>
fixed in the front. This strongly illuminates the objects
which are painted on the slides or slips of glass, and placed
before the lens in an inverted position, and the rays passing
through them and the lens <span class="smcapa">F</span>, fall on a sheet, or other white
surface, placed to receive the image. The glasses on
which the figures are drawn are inverted, in order that the
images of them may be erect.</p>


<p class="p6">THE CAMERA LUCIDA.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 127px;">
<img src="images/i_164.jpg" width="127" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This instrument consists of a glass
prism, <span class="smcapa">C</span>, <span class="smcapa">D</span>, <span class="smcapa">D</span>, <span class="smcapa">E</span>, having four sides covered.
The sides <span class="smcapa">C</span>, <span class="smcapa">D</span>, being exposed to
the object to be delineated, rays pass
through the glass and fall on the sloping
side <span class="smcapa">D</span>, <span class="smcapa">E</span>; from this they are reflected
to the top, and finally pass out of the
prism to the eye;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> now from the direction
at which the rays enter the eye,
it receives them as if coming from an
image at <span class="smcapa">A</span>, <span class="smcapa">B</span>, and if a sheet of paper
be placed below the instrument, a perfect
delineation of the object may be
traced with a pencil. This is a very
useful instrument to young draughtsmen.</p>


<p class="p6">PAINTING THE SLIDES.</p>

<p>The slides containing the objects usually shown in a
magic lantern, are to be bought of opticians with the lantern,
and can be procured cheaper and better in this way
than by any attempt at manufacturing them. Should, however,
the young optician wish to make a few slides of
objects of particular interest to himself, he may proceed as
follows:</p>

<p>Draw first on paper the figures you wish to paint, lay it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
on the table, and cover it over with a piece of glass of
this shape; now draw the outlines with a fine camel's
hair pencil in black paint mixed with varnish, and when
this is dry, fill up the other parts with the proper colors, shading
with bistre also mixed with varnish. The transparent
colors are alone to be used in this kind of painting.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_165a.jpg" width="400" height="90" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="p6">TO EXHIBIT THE MAGIC LANTERN.</p>

<p>The room for the exhibition ought to be large, and of an
oblong shape. At one end of it suspend a large sheet so
as to cover the whole of the wall. The company being all
seated, darken the room, and placing the lantern with its
tube in the direction of the sheet, introduce one of the
slides into the slit, taking care to invert the figures; then
adjust the focus of the glasses in the tube by drawing it in
or out as required, and a perfect representation of the
object will appear.</p>


<p class="p6">EFFECTS OF THE MAGIC LANTERN.</p>

<p>Most extraordinary effects may be produced by means of
the magic lantern; one of the most effective of which is a</p>


<p class="p6">TEMPEST AT SEA.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_165b.jpg" width="400" height="222" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This is effected by having two slides painted, one with
the tempest as approaching on one side, and continuing in
intensity till it reaches the other. Another slide has ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
painted on it, and while the lantern is in use, that containing
the ships is dexterously drawn before the other, and
represents <em>ships in the storm</em>.</p>

<p>The effects of sunrise, moonlight, starlight, &amp;c., may be
imitated, also by means of double sliders;
and figures may be introduced sometimes
of fearful proportions.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 151px;">
<img src="images/i_166a.jpg" width="151" height="182" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Heads may be made to nod, faces to
laugh; eyes may be made to roll, teeth
to gnash; crocodiles may be made to
swallow tigers; combats may be represented;
but one of the most instructive
uses of the slides is to make them illustrative
of astronomy, and to show the rotation
of the seasons, the cause of eclipses, the mountains
in the moon, spots on the sun, and the various motions of
the planetary bodies, and their satellites.</p>


<p class="p6">THE PHANTASMAGORIA.</p>

<p>Between the phantasmagoria and the magic lantern there
is this difference; in common magic lanterns the figures
are painted on transparent glass, consequently the image
on the screen is a circle of light having figures upon it; but
in the phantasmagoria all the glass is made opaque, except
the figures, which, being painted in transparent colors, the
light shines through them, and no light can come upon the
screen except that which passes through the figure, as is
here represented.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_166b.jpg" width="450" height="102" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There is no sheet to receive the picture, but the representation
is thrown on a thin screen of silk or muslin placed
between <em>the spectators and the lantern</em>. The images are made
to appear approaching and receding by removing the lantern
further from the screen, or bringing it nearer to it. This is
a great advantage over the arrangements of the magic lantern,
and by it the most astonishing effects are often produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">DISSOLVING VIEWS.</p>

<p>The dissolving views, by which one landscape or scene
appears to pass into the other while the scene is changing,
are produced by using two magic lanterns placed side by
side, and that can be a little inclined towards each other
when necessary, so as to mix the rays of light proceeding
from the lenses of each together, which produces that confusion
of images, in which one view melts as it were into
the other, which gradually becomes clear and distinct.</p>


<p class="p6">HOW TO RAISE A GHOST.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_167.jpg" width="227" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The magic lantern or phantasmagoria, may be used in a
number of marvelous ways, but in none more striking than
in raising an apparent specter. Let an open box, <span class="smcapa">A B</span>, about
three feet long, a foot and half broad, and two feet high, be
prepared. At one end of this place a small swing dressing
glass, and at the other let a magic lantern be fixed with its
lenses in a direction towards the glass. A glass should now
be made to slide up and down in the groove <span class="smcapa">C D</span>, to which a
cord and pulley should be attached, the end of the cord
coming to the part of the box marked <span class="smcapa">A</span>. On this glass the
most hideous specter that can be imagined may be painted,
but in a squat or contracted position, and when all is done,
the lid of the box must be prepared by raising a kind of
gable at the end of the box <span class="smcapa">B</span>, and in its lower part at <span class="smcapa">E</span>, an
oval hole should be cut sufficiently large to suffer the rays
reflected from the glass to pass through them. On the top
of the box <span class="smcapa">F</span> place a chafing dish, upon which put some burning
charcoal. Now light the lamp <span class="smcapa">G</span> in the lantern, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sprinke'">sprinkle</ins>
some powdered camphor or white incense on the charcoal,
adjust the slide on which the specter is painted, and the image
will be thrown upon the smoke. In performing this feat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the room must be darkened, and the box should be placed on
a high table, that the hole through which the light comes
may not be noticed.</p>


<p class="p6">THE THAUMATROPE.</p>

<p>This word is derived from two Greek words, one of which
signifies <em>wonder</em>, and the other <em>to turn</em>. It is a very pretty
philosophical toy, and is founded upon the principle in optics,
that an impression made upon the retina of the eye lasts for
a short interval after the object which produced it has been
withdrawn. The impression which the mind receives lasts
for about the eighth part of a second, as may be easily shown
by whirling round a lighted stick, which if made to complete
the circle within that period, will exhibit not a fiery point,
but a fiery circle in the air.</p>


<p class="p6">THE BIRD IN THE CAGE.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of cardboard of the size of a penny piece, and
paint on one side a bird, and on the other a cage; fasten
two pieces of thread, one on each side, at opposite points of
the card, so that the card can be made to revolve by twirling
the threads with the finger and thumb; while the toy is
in its revolution, the bird will be seen within the cage. A
bat may in the same manner be painted on one side of the
card, and a cricketer upon the other, which will exhibit the
same phenomenon, arising from the same principle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_168.jpg" width="400" height="162" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="p6">CONSTRUCTION OF THE PHANTASMASCOPE.</p>

<p>The above-named figure is a Thaumatrope, as much as the
one we are about to describe, although the term Phantasmascope
is generally applied to the latter instrument; which
consists of a disc of darkened tin-plate, with a slit or narrow
opening in it, about two inches in length. It is fixed
upon a stand, and the slit placed upwards, so that it may
easily be looked through. Another disc of pasteboard, about
a foot in diameter, is now prepared and fixed on a similar
stand, but with this difference, that it is made to revolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
round an axis in the center. On this pasteboard disc, paint
in colors a number of frogs in relative and progressive positions
of leaping; make between each figure a slit of about a
quarter of an inch deep; and when this second disc is made to
revolve at a foot distance behind the first, and the eye is
placed near the slit, the whole of the figures, instead of appearing
to revolve with the disc, will all appear in the attitudes
of leaping up and down, increasing in agility as the
velocity of the motion is increased. It is necessary, when
trying the effect of this instrument, to stand before a looking-glass,
and to present the painted face of the machine towards
the glass.</p>

<p>A very great number of figures may be prepared to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'preduce'">produce</ins>
similar effects&mdash;horses with riders in various attitudes
of leaping, toads crawling, snakes twisting and writhing,
faces laughing and crying, men dancing, jugglers throwing
up balls, &amp;c.; all of which, by the peculiar arrangement
above detailed, will seem to be in motion. A little ingenuity
displayed in the construction and painting of the figures
upon the pasteboard disc will afford a great fund of amusement.</p>


<p class="p6">CURIOUS OPTICAL ILLUSION.</p>

<p>One of the most curious facts relating to the science of
vision is the absolute insensibility of a certain portion of the
retina to the impression of light, so that the image of any
object falling on that point would be invisible. When we
look with the right eye, this point will be about fifteen degrees
to the right of the object observed, or to the right of
the axis of the eye, or the point of most distinct vision.
When looking with the left eye, the point will be as far to
the left. The point in question is the basis of the optic nerve,
and its insensibility to light was first observed by the French
philosopher, Mariotte. This remarkable phenomenon may
be experimentally proved in the following manner:</p>

<p>Place on a sheet of writing-paper, at the distance of about
three inches apart, two colored wafers; then, on looking at
the left-hand wafer with the right eye, at the distance of
about a foot, keeping the eye straight above the wafer, and
both eyes parallel with the line which forms the wafers, the
left eye being closed, the right-hand wafer will become invisible;
and a similar effect will take place if we close the
right eye, and look with the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">ANOTHER.</p>

<p>Cut a circular piece of white paper, about two inches in
diameter, which affix to a dark wall. At the distance of
two feet on each side, but a little lower, make two marks;
then place yourself directly opposite the paper, and hold
the end of your finger before your face, so that when the
right eye is open it shall conceal the mark on your left, and
when the left eye is open the mark on your right. If you
then look with both eyes at the end of your finger, the paper
disc will be invisible.</p>


<p class="p6">ANOTHER.</p>

<p>Fix a similar disc of paper, two inches in diameter, at the
height of your eye on a dark wall; a little lower than this,
at the distance of two feet on the right hand, fix another of
about three inches in diameter; now place yourself opposite
the first sheet of paper, and, shutting the left eye, keep the
right eye still fixed on the first object, and when at the distance
of about ten feet, the second piece of paper will be
invisible.</p>

<p>Or, fix three pieces of paper against the wall of a room,
at equal distances, at the height of the eye. Place yourself
directly before them, at a few yards distance, close your
right eye, and look at them with your left, when you will see
only two of them, suppose the first and second; alter your
position a second time, and you will see the second and third,
but never the whole three pieces together.</p>

<p>On a sheet of black paper, or other dark ground, place two
white wafers, having their centers three inches distant.
Vertically above the paper, and to the left, look with the
right eye, at twelve inches from it, and so, that when looking
down on it, the line joining the two eyes shall be parallel
to that joining the center of the wafers. In this situation
close the left eye, and look full with the right perpendicularly
at the wafer below it, when this wafer only will be seen, the
other being completely invisible. But if it be removed ever
so little from its place, either to the right or left, above or
below, it will become immediately visible, and start, as it
were, into existence. "It will cease to be thought singular,"
says Sir John Herschel, "that this fact of the absolute
invisibility of objects in a certain point of the field of view
of each eye should be one of which not one person in ten
thousand is apprized, when we learn that it is not extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
uncommon to find persons who have for some time been totally
blind with one eye without being aware of the fact."</p>


<p class="p6">THE PICTURE IN THE AIR.</p>

<p>One of the numerous optical illusions which have, from
time to time, been evolved by scientific minds, is that of
making an image or picture appear in the air. This is produced
by means of a mirror, and an object in relief, upon
which a strong light is thrown&mdash;the mirror being set
at such an angle as to throw up the reflection of the image
to a certain point, in the view of the spectator. This illusion
is produced as follows: Let a screen be constructed
in which is an arched aperture, the center of which may be
five feet from the floor; behind the screen is placed a large
mirror of an elliptical form. An object is now placed behind
the screen, upon which the light of a strong lamp is thrown
from a point above the mirror, and is received by the mirror
and reflected to the center of the arched cavity in the screen,
where it will appear to the spectator. Care should be taken
to place the image in an inverted position, and the light
should be so placed that none of it may reach the opening:
the light must also be very powerful.</p>


<p class="p6">BREATHING LIGHT AND DARKNESS.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/i_171.jpg" width="210" height="95" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The following experiment, if performed with care, is exceedingly
striking. Let <span class="smcapa">S</span> be a candle, whose light falls
at an angle of 56° 45´ upon two plate glasses, <span class="smcapa">A</span> <span class="smcapa">B</span>, placed
close to each other; and let the reflected rays, <span class="smcapa">A C</span>, <span class="smcapa">B D</span>, fall
at the same angle upon two similar plates, <span class="smcapa">C D</span>, but so placed
that the plane of reflection from
the latter is at right angles to the
plane of reflection from the former.
An eye placed at <span class="smcapa">E</span>, and looking
at the same time on the two plates,
<span class="smcapa">C</span> and <span class="smcapa">D</span>, will see very faint images
of the candle <span class="smcapa">S</span>; which by a slight adjustment of the plates,
may be made to disappear almost wholly, allowing the plate
<span class="smcapa">C</span> to remain where it is. Change the position of <span class="smcapa">D</span> till its inclination
to the ray <span class="smcapa">B D</span> is diminished about 3°, or made
nearly 53° 11´. The distance may be easily found by a
little practice. When this is done, the image that had disappeared
on looking into <span class="smcapa">D</span>, will be restored, so that the
spectator at <span class="smcapa">E</span>, upon looking into the two mirrors, <span class="smcapa">C</span> <span class="smcapa">D</span>, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
see no light in <span class="smcapa">C</span>, because the candle has nearly disappeared,
while the candle is distinctly seen in <span class="smcapa">D</span>. If, while the spectator
is looking into these two mirrors, either he or another
person breathes upon them gently and quickly, the breath
will revive the extinguished image in <span class="smcapa">C</span>, and will extinguish
the visible image in <span class="smcapa">D</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">Explanation.</span>&mdash;The light <span class="smcapa">A</span>, <span class="smcapa">C</span>, <span class="smcapa">B</span>, <span class="smcapa">D</span> is polarized by reflection
from the plates <span class="smcapa">A</span> <span class="smcapa">B</span>, because it is incident at the polarizing
angle 56° 45´ for glass. When we breathe upon the
plates <span class="smcapa">C</span> <span class="smcapa">D</span>, we form upon their surface a thin film of water,
whose polarizing angle is 53° 11´, so that if the polarized
rays <span class="smcapa">A C</span>, <span class="smcapa">B D</span>, fall upon the plates <span class="smcapa">C D</span>, at an angle of 53° 11´,
the candle from which they proceed would not be visible,
or they would not suffer reflection from the plates <span class="smcapa">C D</span>. At all
the other angles the light would be reflected, and the candle
visible. Now the plate <span class="smcapa">D</span> is placed at an angle of 53° 11´,
and <span class="smcapa">C</span> at an angle of 56° 45´, so that when a film of water is
breathed upon them, the light will be reflected from the
latter, and none from the former; that is, the act of breathing
upon the glass plates will restore the invisible, and extinguish
the visible image.</p>


<p class="p6">TO SHOW WHAT RAYS OF LIGHT DO NOT OBSTRUCT EACH OTHER.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 218px;">

<p>Make a small hole in a sheet of pasteboard <span class="smcapa">A</span>, and placing
it upright before three candles <span class="smcapa">B</span>, placed closely together, it
will be found that the images of
all the candle flames will be formed
separately on a piece of paper
<span class="smcapa">C</span>, laid on the table to receive them.
This proves that the rays of light
do not obstruct each other in their
progress, although all cross in
passing through the hole.</p>


<p class="p6">HOW TO SEE THROUGH A PHILADELPHIA BRICK.</p>

<p>Construct a hollow box or case, like the figure in the margin.
One side is purposely removed in the engraving, to
enable you to see the arrangement of the interior, <span class="smcapa">A</span>, <span class="smcapa">B</span>, <span class="smcapa">C</span>,
and <span class="smcapa">D</span>, are four small pieces of looking-glass, all placed at
an angle of 45°, with respect to those sides of the box on
which they are fixed; at <span class="smcapa">E</span> and <span class="smcapa">G</span>, two flat pieces of glass
are inserted, as in the eye-glass of a telescope. Supposing
you look through the opening <span class="smcapa">E</span>, in the direction of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
object placed at <span class="smcapa">O</span>, you would see it in the same manner as
if there was an uninterrupted view between <span class="smcapa">E</span> and <span class="smcapa">G</span>, which
is evidently not the case. The cause of this is readily explained.
The image of the object at <span class="smcapa">O</span> is received on the looking-glass
<span class="smcapa">A</span>, by which it is reflected to <span class="smcapa">B</span>, as it is again from
<span class="smcapa">B</span> to <span class="smcapa">C</span>, and afterwards to <span class="smcapa">D</span>; and this last image in <span class="smcapa">D</span> is seen
by the eye of the spectator placed at <span class="smcapa">E</span>, in the same direction
as if in reality he was looking at the real object itself, in the
direction of the dotted line from <span class="smcapa">O</span> to <span class="smcapa">E</span>. From this it is evident
that the placing an opaque body at <span class="smcapa">F</span>, cannot prevent
the object at <span class="smcapa">O</span> being seen. Of course all this arrangement
of the instrument is concealed, and you place it in the hands
of a companion, that he may look through <span class="smcapa">E</span> or <span class="smcapa">G</span>, it matters
not which, at any object placed beyond. You may then
safely lay a wager that your instrument is of so magical a
nature that it will enable you to see through a brick wall;
but as a single brick will be more convenient, and equally
wonderful, you are willing to satisfy his doubts at once. Of
course, the hand or the hat, or any other opaque object, will
answer the same purpose.</p>

<p class="p6">THE STEREOSCOPE.</p>

<p>This is one of the newest and most interesting optical
surprises invented, but, like many other instruments, it is
indulged with a very hard name, which means, "Solids I
see." For mere amusement, the instrument supplied with
the necessary pictures may suffice, and they are now sold
like the kaleidoscope at all optical instrument makers, toyshops,
&amp;c. The effect consists in obtaining the perfect
solidity of a geometric object from two ordinary drawings,
pictures of columns, statuary, figures, flowers, &amp;c., &amp;c., having
a rounded appearance, "breadth," and keeping, which
induce the spectator to believe he is gazing at the natural
figure. Our limits preclude a lengthened description of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
philosophy of this instrument, the invention of Professor
Wheatstone. We may, however, first recommend our readers
to study the structure of the eye, in Brewster's Treatise on
Optics, which may be thoroughly impressed on the mind
by dissecting carefully the eye of a sheep or bullock. Now,
if we cut open a portion of the eye of a recently killed
animal, and look in upon the retina, which is a delicate network
of nerves, and is considered the "mind of the eye," we
shall behold all images inverted. How then, do we see
them upright? Again, as we have two eyes at a distance
from each other, the images formed on the two retinæ cannot
be precisely alike: how is it that confusion is not the
result, instead of perfect images, in which we can appreciate
the geometric niceties of length, breadth, and thickness?
Now the stereoscope assists us in understanding these difficult
questions; and, quoting Professor Wheatstone, we
find he states "that the theory which has obtained the
greatest currency is that which assumes that an object is
seen single because its pictures fall on corresponding points
of the two retinæ; that is, on points which are similarly
situated with respect to the two centers, both in distance
and position. This theory supposes that the pictures projected
on the retinæ, are exactly similar to each other corresponding
points of the two pictures falling on corresponding
points of the two retinæ."</p>

<p>Now, the fact is, that an object presents an entirely different
appearance to each eye. Sir D. Brewster remarks,
"That were a painter called upon to take drawings of a
statue, as seen by each eye, he would fix at the height of
his eyes a metallic plate, with two small holes in it, and he
would then draw the statue as seen through the holes by
each eye." With the utmost care, however, he could not
reproduce the statue by their union. In order to do this, a
camera with <em>two lenses</em> of the same aperture and focal length,
placed at the same distance as the <em>two eyes</em>, must be constructed
and used.</p>

<p>The stereoscope is, consequently, an imitation of the
powers of the eyes, giving solidity and a perfect relievo
appearance to any two pictures which might be drawn
separately from the two lenses in the camera obscura mentioned.
That is to say, if it were possible to be behind the
retina of each eye, and draw the two pictures of any object
seen by our eyes, those pictures put into the stereoscope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
would reproduce the solidity from which they were drawn.</p>

<p>Two instruments are sold, and may be obtained with the
photographic pictures, almost at any optician's, viz.: the
reflecting and the refracting stereoscope, of which we give
drawings.</p>

<p class="p6">OCULAR SPECTRA.</p>

<p>One of the most curious affections of the eye is that in
virtue of which it sees what are called <em>ocular spectra</em>, or
accidental colors. If we place a red wafer on a sheet of
white paper, and, closing one eye, keep the other directed for
some time to the center of the wafer, then, if we turn the
same eye to another part of the paper, we shall see a green
wafer, the color of which will continue to grow fainter and
fainter, as we continue to look at it.</p>

<p>By using differently-colored wafers, we obtain the following
results:</p>

obliquely, as in the direction E, <em>a</em>, <em>c</em>, and
you will see the whole surface shining
like burnished silver, with a strong metallic
reflection; and any object, as a spoon, A, C,
B, immersed in the water, will have its immersed
part, C B, reflected on the surface,
as in a mirror, but with a brilliancy far surpassing
that which can be obtained from

<p>If a soap-bubble be blown up, and set under

<p class="p6">THE KALEIDOSCOPE.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_176c.jpg" width="171" height="109" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If any object be placed between two plane mirrors, inclined
towards each other at an angle of thirty degrees,
three several images will be perceived in the circumference
of a circle. On this principle is formed the kaleidoscope,
invented by Sir David Brewster, and by means of which the
reflected images viewed from a particular point exhibit symmetrical
figures, under an infinite arrangement of beautiful
forms and colors. The kaleidoscope
may be bought at any toy-shop, but it
is requisite that every young person
should be able to construct one for
himself. He must, therefore, procure
a tube of tin or paper, of about ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
inches in length, and two and a half or three inches in diameter.
One end of this should be stopped up with tin or
paper, securely fastened, in which is to be made a hole,
about the size of a small pea, for the eye to look through.
Two pieces of well-silvered looking-glass, <span class="smcapa">B</span> <span class="smcapa">B</span>, are now to
be procured; they must be not quite so long
as the tube, and they should be placed in the
tube lengthwise, at an angle of 60 degrees,
meeting together in a point at <span class="smcapa">A</span>, and separating
to the points <span class="smcapa">C</span> <span class="smcapa">C</span>, the polished surfaces
looking inwards. A circular piece of glass is
now to be laid on the top of the edges of the
reflectors, <span class="smcapa">B</span> <span class="smcapa">B</span>; which, by their not being quite so long as
the tube, will allow room for its falling in, and it will be
supported by the edges of the tube, which may be slightly
bent over, to prevent the glass from falling out. This having
been done, now proceed to make the "cap" of the instrument.
A rim of tin or pasteboard must be cut, so as to fit
over the glass end of the tube; and in this, on the outer
side, a piece of ground glass must be fastened, so that the
whole may fit on the tube like the lid of a pill-box. Then,
before putting it on, obtain some small pieces of broken
glass of various colors, beads, little strips of wire, or any
other object, and place them in the cap; and by passing it
over the end, so that the broken glass, &amp;c. has free motion,
the instrument is complete. To use it, apply the eye to the
small hole, and, on turning it, the most beautiful forms will
appear, in the most wonderful combinations.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="105" height="126" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The following curious calculation has been made of the
number of changes this instrument will admit of. Supposing
it to contain 20 small pieces of glass, and that you make
10 changes in a minute, it will take an inconceivable space
of time, <em>i. e.</em> 462,880,899,576 years, and 360 days, to go
through the immense number of changes of which it is
capable.</p>


<p class="p6">SIMPLE SOLAR MICROSCOPE.</p>

<p>Having made a circular hole in a window-shutter, about
three inches in diameter, place in it a glass lens of about
twelve inches focal distance. To the inside of the hole
adapt a tube, having at a small distance from the lens a
slit, capable of receiving one or two very thin plates of
glass, to which the object to be viewed must be affixed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
means of a little gum water exceedingly transparent. Into
this tube fit another, furnished at its extremity with a lens
of half an inch focal distance. Place a mirror before the
hole of the window-shutter on the outside, in such a manner
as to throw the light of the sun into the tube, and you will
have a solar magic lantern.</p>

<p>The method of employing this arrangement of lenses for
microscopic purposes is as follows: Having darkened the
room, and by means of the mirror reflected the sun's rays
on the glasses in a direction parallel to the axis, place some
small object between the two moveable plates of glass, or
affix it to one of them with very transparent gum water, and
bring it exactly into the axis of the tube; if the moveable
tube be then pushed out or drawn in, till the object be a
little beyond the focus, it will be seen painted very distinctly
on a card, or piece of white paper, held at a proper distance,
and will appear to be greatly magnified. A small insect
will appear as a large animal, a hair as big as a walking-stick,
and the almost invisible eels in paste or vinegar as
large as common eels.</p>


<p class="p6">ANAMORPHOSES.</p>

<p>This is a very curious optical effect, producing a distorted
and grotesque figure from a regular one. The term
is derived from two Greek words, signifying a distortion of
figure, and by its means many optical puzzles may be produced
geometrically.</p>

<p>Take any subject, such as the portrait of a head; divide
it vertically and horizontally with parallel lines, of which
the outer sides shall form the boundary, <span class="smcapa">A</span>, <span class="smcapa">B</span>, <span class="smcapa">C</span>, <span class="smcapa">D</span>, and the
whole shall be equi-distant. Then, on a separate piece of
paper, or cardboard, prepare a drawing similar to Fig. 2 by
the following means:</p>

<p>1. Draw a horizontal line, <em>a b</em>, equal to <span class="smcapa">A B</span>, and divide it
into as many equal parts as the latter is divided.</p>

<p>2. Let fall a perpendicular line, <em>e v</em>, from the middle of <em>a b</em>,
and then draw <em>s v</em> parallel to <em>a b</em>.</p>

<p>3. Both <em>e v</em> and <em>s v</em> may be any length at pleasure, but the
longer the first is, and the shorter the other, so will the anamorphoses
be more and more deformed. The proportions in
our figures are sufficiently different.</p>

<p>4. After having drawn from the point <em>v</em> right lines, <em>v</em> 1,
<em>v</em> 2, <em>v</em> 3, <em>v</em> 4, to the divisions of <em>a b</em>, draw the line <em>s b</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
through each point where <em>s b</em> intersects the divergent lines,
draw other horizontal lines parallel to <em>a b</em>. We now have
a <em>trapezium</em>, <em>a b c d</em>, divided into as many cells as the square
in Fig. 1.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_179.jpg" width="320" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The next step is to fill up all the cells of Fig. 2 with portions
of the device, proportionate to their position in Fig. 1.
For instance, in Fig. 1 the nose is in the second vertical
division from the left, and in the third and fourth horizontal
divisions from the top, and that portion of the face must accordingly
be placed in a corresponding part of Fig. 2.</p>

<p>By these means we procure the anamorphosis seen in Fig.
2, which, when viewed from a particular position, will lose
all its distortion, and assume an appearance resembling that
in Fig. 1. This position lies immediately over the point <em>v</em>,
and at a height above it equal to the length of the line <em>s v</em>;
and the means of determining it are as follow:</p>

<p>Place the drawing horizontally before a window; take a
slip of card, and rest its lower edge on the line <em>s v</em>, the card
being accurately vertical; pierce a small hole in the card
vertically over the point <em>v</em>, and at a height from it equal to
the length of the line <em>s v</em>, then, with the eye placed immediately
behind the card, look through the orifice at the
anamorphosis, and it will be found that as soon as the eye
has become accustomed to the novelty of the experiment
the anamorphosis will lose its distortion, and appear almost
exactly like the symmetrical figure.</p>

<p>It would be very difficult, and would require geometrical
reasoning of a lengthened kind, to show why this particular
form of construction should lead to such results.</p>

<p class="p6">THE COSMORAMA.</p>

<p>The principle upon which the cosmorama is formed is so
simple, that any person may easily fit up one in a small summer
house, &amp;c. Nothing more is necessary than to fix in a
hole a double convex lens of about three feet focus, <span class="smcapa">A</span>, and
at rather less than this distance a picture, <span class="smcapa">B</span>, is to be hung.
To absorb all the rays of light but those necessary for seeing
the picture, a squared frame of wood blackened on the
inside is placed between the lens and the picture. The picture
may be hung in a large box having a light coming in
upon it from above, or in a small closet illuminated in the
same manner. Should it be wished to show the picture by
candle-light, a lamp, <em>c</em>, may be placed on the top of the
wooden frame, and if the light of this be converged by a
lens to a moderate radius, it will be more effective.</p>

</div>

<p>Landscapes or other matters may be drawn
so as to produce curious optical illusions by
the following method. Take a piece of smooth
white pasteboard, and sketch the design upon
it. Prick the outlines in every part with a fine
pin or needle, then place the pricked drawing
in a perpendicular position, and put a lighted
candle behind it. Place before it another piece
of pasteboard, and follow with a pencil the lines
given by the light, and you have produced a distorted landscape.
Now take away the candle and the pricked drawing,
and place your eye where the light was, and the drawing
will assume the regular form. To get your eye in the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>per
position, it will be advisable to cut out a piece of card
according to the preceding pattern, and raising it on its
base, <span class="smcapa">B</span>, look through the hole at <span class="smcapa">A</span>, when the object will
appear in its proper proportions.</p>

<p class="p6">THE MAGIC COIN.</p>

<p>Among the numerous experiments with which science astonishes
and sometimes even strikes terror into the ignorant,
there is none more calculated to produce this effect than
that of displaying to the eye in absolute darkness the
legend or inscription upon a coin. To do this, take a silver
coin (I have always used an old one), and after polishing
the surface as much as possible, make the parts of it which
are raised rough by the action of an acid, the parts not
raised, or those which are to be rendered darkest, retaining
their polish. If the coin thus prepared is placed upon a
mass of red-hot iron, and removed into a dark room, the inscription
upon it will become less luminous than the rest, so
that it may be distinctly read by the spectator. The mass
of red-hot iron should be concealed from the observer's eye,
both for the purpose of rendering the eye fitter for observing
the effect, and of removing all doubt that the inscription is
really read in the dark, that is, without receiving any light,
direct or reflected, from any other body. If, in place of
polishing the depressed parts, and roughening its raised
parts, we make the raised parts polished, and roughen the
depressed parts, the inscription will now be less luminous
than the depressed parts.</p>

<p>There is no subject of such importance as Mechanics, as
its principles are founded upon the properties of matter and
the laws of motion; and in knowing something of these,
the tyro will lay the foundation of all substantial knowledge.</p>

<p>The properties of matter are the following: Solidity (or
Impenetrability), Divisibility, Mobility, Elasticity, Brittleness,
Malleability, Ductility, and Tenacity.</p>

<p>The laws of motion are as follow:</p>

<p>1. Every body continues in a state of rest or of uniform
rectilineal motion, unless affected by some extraneous force.</p>

<p>2. The change of motion is always proportionate to the
impelling force.</p>

<p>3. Action and reaction are always equal and contrary.</p>


<p class="p6">EXPERIMENT OF THE LAW OF MOTION.</p>

<p>In shooting at "taw," if the marble be struck "plump,"
as it is called, it moves forward exactly in the same line of
direction; but if struck sideways, it will move in an oblique
direction, and its course will be in a line situated between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the direction of its former motion and that of the force impressed.
This is called the resolution of forces.</p>


<p class="p6">BALANCING.</p>

<p>The center of gravity in a body is that part about which
all the other parts equally balance each other. In balancing
a stick upon the finger, or upon the chin, it is necessary
only to keep the chin or finger exactly under the point which
is called the center of gravity.</p>

<p>Cut out the figure of a horse, and
having fixed a curved iron wire to the
under part of its body, place a small
ball of lead upon it. Place the hind
legs of the horse on the table, and it
will rock to and fro. If the ball be removed,
the horse would immediately
tumble, because unsupported, the center
of gravity being in the front of the
prop; but upon the ball being replaced, the center of gravity
immediately changes its position, and is brought under the
prop, and the horse is again in equilibrio.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>TO CONSTRUCT A FIGURE, WHICH, BEING PLACED UPON A CURVED SURFACE,
AND INCLINED IN ANY POSITION, SHALL, WHEN LEFT TO ITSELF,
RETURN TO ITS FORMER POSITION.</p></blockquote>

<p>The feet of the figure rest on a curved pivot, which
is sustained by two loaded balls below; for the weight of
these balls being much greater than that of the figure, their
effect is to bring the center of gravity of the whole beneath
the point on which it rests; consequently the equilibrium
will resist any slight force to disturb it.</p>

Fix a quarter dollar into another cork, by
cutting a nick in it; and stick into the

table. That it may be fixed in
this situation, place another
stick with one of its ends resting against the side at the
bottom of the pail, and its other end against the first stick,
where there should be a notch to retain it. By these means,
the pail will remain fixed in that situation, without being
able to incline to either side; nor can the stick slide along
the table, or move along its edge, without raising the center
of gravity of the pail, and the water it contains.</p>

of the bottle. It is necessary, in order to
succeed in this feat, to be particularly
careful in choosing a stout straw, which

<p class="p6">SAND IN THE HOUR-GLASS.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that the flow of sand in the hour-glass
is perfectly equable, whatever may be the quantity
in the glass; that is, the sand runs no faster when the
upper half of the glass is quite full than when it is nearly
empty. It would, however, be natural enough to conclude
that, when full of sand, it would be more swiftly urged
through the aperture, than when the glass was only a quarter
full, and near the close of the hour.</p>

<p>The fact of the even flow of sand may be proved by a
very simple experiment. Provide some silver sand, dry it
over or before the fire, and pass it through a tolerably fine
sieve. Then take a tube, of any length or diameter, closed
at one end, in which make a small hole, say the eighth of
an inch; stop this with a peg, and fill up the tube with the
sifted sand. Hold the tube steadily, or fix it to a wall, or
frame, at any height from a table; remove the peg, and
permit the sand to flow in any measure for any given time,
and note the quantity. Then, let the tube be emptied, and
only half or a quarter filled with the sand; measure again,
for a like time, and the same quantity of sand will flow:
even if you press the sand in the tube with a ruler or stick,
the flow of the sand through the hole will not be increased.</p>

<p>The above is explained by the fact, that when the sand is
poured into the tube, it fills it with a succession of conical
heaps, and that all the weight which the bottom of the tube
sustains is only that of the heap which <em>first</em> falls upon it;
as the succeeding heaps do not press downwards, but only
against the sides or walls of the tube.</p>


<p class="p6">RESISTANCE OF SAND.</p>

<p>From the above experiment it may be concluded, that it
is extremely difficult to thrust sand out of a tube by means
of a fitting plug or piston; and this, upon trial, is found to
be the case. Fit a piston to a tube (exactly like a boy's
pop-gun,) pour some sand in, and try with the utmost
strength of the arm to push out the sand. It will be found
impossible to do this: rather than the sand should be shot
out, the tube will burst at the sides.</p>

<h2><a name="TRICKS_IN_HYDRAULICS_AND_HYDROSTATICS" id="TRICKS_IN_HYDRAULICS_AND_HYDROSTATICS"></a>TRICKS IN HYDRAULICS.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p>The science of Hydraulics comprehends the laws which
regulate non-elastic fluids in motion, and especially water,
&amp;c.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_189.jpg" width="311" height="265" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Water can only be set in motion by two causes&mdash;the
pressure of the atmosphere, or its own gravity. The principal
law concerning fluids is, that they always preserve their
own level. Hence water can be distributed over a town
from any reservoir that is higher than the houses to be supplied;
and the same principle will enable us to form fountains
in a garden, or other place. Should any of our young
friends wish to form a fountain, or jet-d'-eau, they may, by
bringing a pipe from <span class="smcapa">T</span>, a water-tank, which should be at the
upper part of the house, convey the water down to the garden.
Then by leading it through the earth, underneath the
path or grass plot, and turning it to a perpendicular position,
the water will spring out, and rise nearly as high as
the level of that in the tank. The part of the pipe at <span class="smcapa">B</span>
should have a turnkey, so that the water may be let on or
shut off at pleasure.</p>


<p class="p6">THE PUMP.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 156px;">
<img src="images/i_190a.jpg" width="156" height="318" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 107px;">
<img src="images/i_190b.jpg" width="107" height="365" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The action of the common pump is as follows: When
the handle <span class="smcapa">A</span> is raised, the piston-rod <span class="smcapa">B</span> descends, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
brings the piston-valve, called the sucker, or bucket, to
another valve, <span class="smcapa">C</span>, which is fixed, and opens inwards towards
the piston. When the handle is drawn down, the piston is
raised, and, as it is air-tight, a vacuum is produced between
the two valves; the air in the valve of the pump, betwixt
the lower valve and the water, then forces open the lower
valve, and rushes through to fill up this vacuum;
and the air in the pump being less dense than
the external atmosphere, the water is forced a
short way up the barrel. When the piston
again descends to the lower valve, the air
between them is again forced out by forcing
open the upper valve; and when the piston is
raised, a vacuum is again produced, and the air
below the lower valve rushes up, and the water
in consequence is again raised a little further.
This operation continues until the water rises
above the lower valve; at every stroke afterwards,
the water passes through the valve of
the descending piston, and is raised by it, on its
ascent, until it issues out of the spout.</p>


<p class="p6">THE HYDRAULIC DANCER.</p>

<p>Make a little figure of cork, in the shape of a
dancing mountebank, sailor, &amp;c. In this figure
place a small hollow cone, made of thin leaf brass. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
this figure is placed upon any jet-d'-eau, such as that of the
fountain recommended to be constructed, it will be suspended
on the top of the water, and perform a great variety
of amusing motions. If a hollow ball of very thin copper,
about an inch in diameter, be placed on a similar cone, it
will remain suspended, turning round and spreading the
water all about it.</p>


<p class="p6">THE SYPHON.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 213px;">
<img src="images/i_191a.jpg" width="213" height="165" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The syphon is a bent tube, having one leg shorter than
the other. It acts by the pressure
of the atmosphere being removed
from the surface of a fluid, which
makes it to rise above its common
level at <span class="smcapa">B</span>. In order to make a
syphon act, it is necessary first to
fill both legs quite full of the fluid;
and then the shorter leg must be
placed in the vessel to be emptied.
Immediately upon withdrawing the finger from the longer
leg, the liquor will flow. Any young person may form a
syphon by a small piece of leaden pipe, bent into the form
above.</p>


<p class="p6">THE WATER SNAIL, OR ARCHIMEDIAN SCREW</p>

<p>may easily be constructed. Purchase a yard of small leaden
pipe, and twist it round a pole, as in the following figure,
<span class="smcapa">A</span>; place a handle at its upper end, <span class="smcapa">B</span>, and let its lower end
rest in the water. Between the last turn of the pipe and
the orifice place a paddle-wheel, <span class="smcapa">C</span>. Now, should the water
be that of a running stream, the force of the stream will turn
the pipe, and the water will rise in it till it empties itself
into the trough at <span class="smcapa">D</span>. Should the water have no motion, the
turning of the handle at <span class="smcapa">B</span> will elevate the water from the
lower to the higher level.</p>

<p class="p6">THE BOTTLE EJECTMENT.</p>

<p>Fill a small white glass bottle, with a very narrow neck,
full of wine; place it in a glass vase, which must previously
have sufficient water in it to rise above the mouth of the
bottle. Immediately you will perceive the wine rise, in the
form of a little column, toward the surface of the water, and
the water will, in the mean time, begin to take the place of
the wine at the bottom of the bottle. The cause of this is,
that the water is heavier than the wine, which it displaces,
and forces it to rise toward the surface.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MAGIC OF HYDROSTATICS WITH THE ANCIENTS.</p>

<p>The principles of <em>Hydrostatics</em> were available in the work
of magical deception. The marvelous fountain which Pliny
describes in the island of Andros as discharging wine for
seven days, and water during the rest of the year,&mdash;the
spring of oil which broke out in Rome to welcome the return
of Augustus from the Sicilian war,&mdash;the three empty urns
which filled themselves with wine at the annual feast of
Bacchus in the city of Elis,&mdash;the glass tomb of Belus, which
was full of oil, and which, when once emptied by Xerxes,
could not again be filled,&mdash;the weeping statues, and the
perpetual lamps of the ancients,&mdash;were all the obvious
effect of the equilibrium and pressure of fluids.</p>


<p class="p6">TO EMPTY A GLASS UNDER WATER.</p>

<p>Fill a wine-glass with water, place over its mouth a card,
so as to prevent the water from escaping, and put the glass,
mouth downwards, into a basin of water. Next, remove
the card, and raise the glass partly above the surface, but
keep its mouth below the surface, so that the glass still remains
completely filled with water. Then insert one end of
a quill or reed in the water below the mouth of the glass,
and blow gently at the other end, when air will ascend in
bubbles to the highest part of the glass, and expel the water
from it; and, if you continue to blow <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'throw'">through</ins> the quill, all the
water will be emptied from the glass, which will be filled
with air.</p>

<h2><a name="TRICKS_IN_ACOUSTICS" id="TRICKS_IN_ACOUSTICS"></a>TRICKS IN ACOUSTICS.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p>Acoustics is the science relating to sound and hearing.
Sound is heard when any shock or impulse is given to the
air, or to any other body which is in contact directly or indirectly
with the ear.</p>


<p class="p6">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOUND AND NOISE.</p>

<p>Noises are made by the cracks of whips, the beating of
hammers, the creak of a file or saw, or the hubbub of a
multitude. But when a bell is struck, the bow of a violin
drawn across the strings, or the wetted finger turned round
a musical glass, we have what are properly called sounds.</p>


<p class="p6">SOUNDS, HOW PROPAGATED.</p>

<p>Sounds are propagated on all bodies much after the manner
that waves are in water, with a velocity of 1,142 feet
in a second. Sounds in liquids and in solids are more rapid
than in air. Two stones rubbed together may be heard in
water at half a mile; solid bodies convey sounds to great
distances, and pipes may be made to convey the voice over
every part of the house.</p>


<p class="p6">VISIBLE VIBRATION.</p>

<p>Provide a glass goblet about two thirds filled with colored
water, draw a fiddle bow against its edge, and the surface
of the water will exhibit a pleasing figure, composed of
fans, four, six, or eight in number, dependent on the dimensions
of the vessel, but chiefly on the pitch of the note produced.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/i_193.jpg" width="110" height="178" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Or, nearly fill a glass with water, draw the
bow strongly against its edge, the water will
be elevated and depressed; and when the vibration
has ceased, and the surface of the
water has become tranquil, these elevations
will be exhibited in the form of a curved line,
passing round the interior surface of the glass,
and above the surface of the water. If the
action of the bow be strong, the water will be
sprinkled on the inside of the glass, above the
liquid surface, and this sprinkling will show the curved line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
very perfectly, as in the engraving. The water should be
carefully poured, so that the glass above the liquid be preserved
dry; the portion of the glass between the edge and
curved line will then be seen partially sprinkled; but, between
the level of the water and the curved line, it will
have become wholly wetted, thereby indicating the height
to which the fluid has been thrown.</p>


<p class="p6">TRANSMITTED VIBRATION.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_194a.jpg" width="281" height="88" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Provide a long, flat glass ruler or rod, as in the engraving,
and cement it with mastic to the edge of a drinking glass,
fixed into a wooden stand; support the other end of the rod
very lightly on a piece of
cork, and strew its upper
surface with sand; set the
glass in vibration by a bow,
at a point opposite where
the rod meets it, and the motions will be communicated to
the rod without any change in their direction. If the apparatus
be inverted, and sand be strewed on the under side of
the rod, the figures will be seen to correspond with those
produced on the upper surface.</p>


<p class="p6">DOUBLE VIBRATION.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 158px;">
<img src="images/i_194b.jpg" width="158" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Provide two disks of metal or glass, precisely of the same
dimensions, and a glass or metal rod; cement the two disks
at their centers to the ends of the rod,
as in the engraving, and strew their upper
surfaces with sand. Cause one of
the disks, viz., the upper one, to vibrate
by a bow, and its vibration will be exactly
imitated by the lower disk, and the
sand strewed over both will arrange
itself in precisely the same forms on
both disks.</p>


<p class="p6">CHAMPAGNE AND SOUND.</p>

<p>Pour sparkling champagne into a glass, until it is half
full, when the glass will lose its power of ringing by a
stroke upon its edge, and will emit only a disagreeable and
puffy sound. Nor will a glass ring while the wine is brisk,
and filled with air-bubbles; but as the effervescence subsides,
the sound will become clearer and clearer, and when
the air-bubbles have entirely disappeared, the glass will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
ring as usual. If a crumb of bread be thrown into the
champagne, and effervescence be reproduced, the glass will
again cease to ring. The same experiment will also succeed
with soda water, ginger wine, or any other effervescing
liquid.</p>


<p class="p6">MUSIC OF THE SNAIL.</p>

<p>Place a garden snail upon a pane of glass, and in drawing
itself along, it will frequently produce sounds similar to
those of musical glasses.</p>


<p class="p6">THE TUNING-FORK A FLUTE PLAYER.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_195a.jpg" width="284" height="129" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Take a common tuning-fork, and on one of its branches
fasten with sealing-wax a circular piece of card, of the size
of a small wafer, or sufficient nearly to cover the aperture
of a pipe, as the sliding
of the upper end of a flute
with the mouth stopped: it
may be tuned in unison
with the loaded tuning-fork
(a C fork), by means of the
moveable stopper or card,
or the fork may be loaded till the unison is perfect. Then
set the fork in vibration by a blow on the unloaded branch,
and hold the card closely over the mouth of the pipe, as in
the engraving, when a note of surprising clearness and
strength will be heard. Indeed, a flute may be made to
"speak" perfectly well, by holding close to the opening a
vibrating tuning-fork, while the fingering proper to the note
of the fork is at the same time performed.</p>


<p class="p6">MUSICAL BOTTLES.</p>

<p>Provide two glass bottles, and tune them by pouring water
into them, so that each corresponds to the sound of a different
tuning-fork. Then apply both tuning-forks to the
mouth of each bottle alternately, when that sound only will
be heard, in each case, which is reciprocated by the unisonant
bottle; or, in other words, by that bottle which contains
a column of air, susceptible of vibrating in unison
with the fork.</p>


<p class="p6">THEORY OF WHISPERING.</p>

<p>Apartments of a circular or elliptical form are best <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'calcuated'">calculated</ins>
for the exhibition of this phenomenon. If a person
stand near the wall, with his face turned to it, and whisper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
a few words, they may be more distinctly heard at nearly
the opposite side of the apartment, than if the listener was
situated near to the speaker.</p>


<p class="p6">THEORY OF THE VOICE.</p>

<p>Provide a species of whistle, common as a child's toy or a
sportsman's call, in the form of a hollow cylinder, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'abou'">about</ins>
three fourths of an inch in diameter, closed at both ends by
flat circular plates, with holes in their centers. Hold this
toy between the teeth and lips; blow through it, and you
may produce sounds varying in pitch with the force with
which you blow. If the air be cautiously graduated, all the
sounds within the compass of a double octave may be produced
from it; and, if great precaution be taken in the
management of the wind, tones even yet graver may be
brought out. This simple instrument, or toy, has indeed
the greatest resemblance to the larynx, which is the organ
of voice.</p>


<p class="p6">TO TUNE A GUITAR WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF THE EAR.</p>

<p>Make one string to sound, and its vibrations will, with
much force, be transferred to the next string: this transference
may be seen, by placing a saddle of paper (like an inverted Λ)
upon the string, at first in a state of rest. When
this string <em>hears</em> the other, the saddle will be shaken, or fall
off; when both strings are in harmony, the paper will be
very little, or not at all shaken.</p>


<p class="p6">PROGRESS OF SOUND.</p>

<p>When a bow is drawn across the strings of a violin, the
impulses produced may be rendered evident by fixing a
small steel bead upon the bow; when looked at by light, or
in sunshine, the bead will seem to form a series of dots during
the passage of the bow.</p>


<p class="p6">TO MAKE AN ÆOLIAN HARP.</p>

<p>This instrument consists of a long narrow box of very
thin pine, about six inches deep, with a circle in the middle
of the upper side, of an inch and half in diameter, in which
are to be drilled small holes. On this side seven, ten, or
more strings of very fine catgut are stretched over bridges
at each end like the bridge of a fiddle, and screwed up or
relaxed with screw pins. The strings must all be tuned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
one and the same note,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and the instrument should be placed
in a window partly open, in which the width is exactly
equal to the length of the harp, with the sash just raised to
give the air admission. When the air blows upon these
strings with different degrees of force it will excite different
tones of sound. Sometimes the blast brings out all the
tones in full concert, and sometimes it sinks them to the
softest murmurs.</p>

<p>A colossal imitation of the instrument just described was
invented at Milan in 1786, by the Abbate Gattoni. He
stretched seven strong iron wires, tuned to the notes of the
gamut, from the top of a tower sixty feet high, to the house
of a Signor Moscate, who was interested in the success of
the experiment, and this apparatus, called the "giant's
harp," in blowing weather yielded lengthened peals of harmonious
music. In a storm this music was sometimes heard
at the distance of several miles.</p>


<p class="p6">THE INVISIBLE GIRL.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_197.jpg" width="235" height="162" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The facility with which the voice circulates through tubes
was known to the ancients, and no doubt has afforded the
priests of all religions means of deception to the ignorant
and credulous. But of late days the light of science dispels
all such wicked deceptions. A very clever machine
was produced at Paris several years ago, and afterwards
exhibited in New York and other cities in the United
States, under the name of the "Invisible Girl," since
the apparatus was so constructed that the voice of a
female at a distance was heard as if it originated from a
hollow globe, not more than a foot in diameter. It consisted
of a wooden frame something like a tent bedstead, formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
by four pillars <em>a a a a</em>, connected by upper cross rails <em>b b</em>,
and similar rails below, while it terminated above in four
bent wires <em>c c</em>, proceeding at right angles of the frame, and
meeting in a central point. The hollow copper ball <em>d</em>, with
four trumpets, <em>t t</em>, crossing from it at right angles, hung in
the center of the frame, being connected with the wires
alone by four narrow ribbons <em>r r</em>. The questions were proposed
close to the open mouth of one of these trumpets,
and the reply was returned from the same orifice. The
means used in the deception were as follows: a pipe or
tube was attached to one of the hollow pillars, and carried
into another apartment, in which a female was placed; and
this tube having been carried up the leg or pillar of the
instrument to the cross-rails, had apertures exactly opposite
two of the trumpet mouths; so that what was spoken
was immediately answered through a very simple mode of
communication.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MAGIC OF ACOUSTICS.</p>

<p>The science of <em>Acoustics</em> furnished the ancient sorcerers
with some of their best deceptions. The imitation of thunder
in their subterranean temples could not fail to indicate
the presence of a supernatural agent. The golden virgins
whose ravishing voices resounded through the temple of
Delphos,&mdash;the stone from the river Pactolus, whose trumpet
notes scared the robber from the treasure which it guarded,&mdash;the
speaking head which uttered its oracular responses
at Lesbos,&mdash;and the vocal statue of Memnon, which began
at the break of day to accost the rising sun,&mdash;were all deceptions
derived from science, and from a diligent observation
of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'phemomena'">phenomena</ins> of nature.</p>


<p class="p6">Take a long piece of wood, such as the handle of a hair
broom, and placing a watch at one end, apply your ear to the
other, and the tickings will be distinctly heard.</p>


<p class="p6">TO SHOW THAT SOUND DEPENDS ON VIBRATION.</p>

<p>Touch a bell when it is sounding, and the noise ceases;
the same may be done to a musical string with the same results.
Hold a musical pitchfork to the lips, when it is made
to sound, and a quivering motion will be felt from its vibrations.
These experiments show that sound is produced by
the quick motions and vibrations of different bodies.</p>

<p>As the principal object of this volume is to enable the
young reader to learn something in his sports, and to understand
what he is doing, we shall, before proceeding to the
curious tricks and feats connected with the science of numbers,
present him with some arithmetical aphorisms, upon
which most of the following examples are founded.</p>


<p class="p6">APHORISMS OF NUMBER.</p>

<p>1. If two even numbers be added together, or subtracted
from each other, their sum or difference will be an even
number.</p>

<p>2. If two uneven numbers be added or subtracted, their
sum or difference will be an even number.</p>

<p>3. The sum or difference of an even and an uneven number
added or subtracted, will be an uneven number.</p>

<p>4. The product of two even numbers will be an even
number, and the product of two uneven numbers will be an
uneven number.</p>

<p>5. The product of an even and uneven number will be an
even number.</p>

<p>6. If two different numbers be divisible by any one number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
their sum and their difference will also be divisible by
that number.</p>

<p>7. If several different numbers, divided by 3, be added
or multiplied together, their sum and their product will also
be divisible by 3.</p>

<p>8. If two numbers, divisible by 9, be added together, the
sum of the figures in the amount will be either 9, or a number
divisible by 9.</p>

<p>9. If any number be multiplied by 9, or by any other
number divisible by 9, the amount of the figures of the product
will be either 9, or a number divisible by 9.</p>

<p>10. In every arithmetical progression, if the first and last
term be each multiplied by the number of terms, and the
sum of the two products be divided by 2, the quotient will
be the sum of the series.</p>

<p>11. In every geometric progression, if any two terms be
multiplied together, their product will be equal to that term,
which answers to the sum of these two indices. Thus, in
the series&mdash;</p>

<p>If the third and fourth terms 8 and 16 be multiplied together,
the product 128 will be the seventh term of the
series. In like manner, if the fifth term be multiplied into
itself, the product will be the tenth term, and if that sum be
multiplied into itself, the product will be the twentieth term.
Therefore, to find the last, or any other term of a geometric
series, it is not necessary to continue the series beyond a
few of the first terms.</p>

<p>Previous to the numerical recreations, we shall here describe
certain mechanical methods of performing arithmetical
calculations, such as are not only in themselves entertaining,
but will be found more or less useful to the young
reader.</p>


<p class="p6">PALPABLE ARITHMETIC.</p>

<p>The blind mathematician, Dr. Saunderson, adopted a very
ingenious device for performing arithmetical operations by
the sense of touch.</p>

<p>Small cubes of wood were provided, and in one face of
each, nine holes were pierced, thus:</p>

<p>These holes represented the nine digits, as in the figure, and
to denote any figure, a small peg was inserted into the hole
corresponding to it. If the number consisted of several
figures, more cubes were used, one for each. A cipher was
represented by a peg of different shape from that of the
others, and inserted in the central hole.</p>

<p>To perform any arithmetical process, a square board was
provided, divided by ridges into recesses of the same width
as the cubes, and by this the cubes were retained in the required
horizontal and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'perpindicular'">perpendicular</ins> lines. Suppose it was
necessary to add together the numbers 763, 124, 859, the
cubes and pegs would be arranged thus:</p>

<p>Upon a frame are placed wires, parallel
to one another, and at equal distances.
Ten small balls are strung
upon each wire, being placed as in
the margin. The right wire denotes
units, the next tens, and so on, the 7th
wire being the place of millions. In
using the abacus, all the balls are first
ranged at one end, and a number of
them are then moved to the other end
of each wire, to correspond to the
figures required. The example given
in the margin is 15,781, the height of
Mount Blanc.</p>

<p class="p6">NAPIER'S RODS.</p>

<p>The object of this contrivance is to render arithmetical
multiplication more easy, and to secure its correctness; it
was much used by astronomers before the invention of logarithms.</p>

<p>To appreciate the merits of this invention, we must consider
the process of multiplication as usually performed.
Suppose we had to multiply 8,679 by 8:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp; 8,679<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
69,432<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>We first multiply 9 by 8 = 72, and putting down 2 as the
first figure in the product, carry the 7 to add to the next
product of 7 by 8 = 56; this gives us 63, the 3 being put
down as the second figure; 6 is carried to add to the product
of 6 by 8, and so on.</p>

<p>A blunder may be made in each part of this process; for
1st, we might reckon 8 times 9 as some other number than
72; 2d, after multiplying the 7 by the 8, we might add to
the resulting 56 some other figure than the 7, which we
carried; 3d, we may add 56 to 7 inaccurately,
making some other sum of it
than the right one, 63. Errors in a
long multiplication problem are usually
made in one of these three ways, and
to prevent such errors, Lord Napier<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
introduced this useful contrivance.
Thin strips of card, wood, or bone, 9
times as long as they are broad, are
each divided into 9 equal squares, a
figure is printed or written on the top
square, and in each of the squares underneath
is the product of multiplying
that figure by 2, 3, 4, &amp;c., up to 9.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_202.jpg" width="171" height="296" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To use these in multiplication, select
the strips, the top figures of which
make the number to be multiplied. For example:</p>

<p>To multiply 8,679 by 8, look at the eighth line of squares
from the top, and on that line will be found the product of
each of the integers 8, 6, 7, 9, when multiplied by 8. We have
then to write down the 2 as the first figure of the product,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
add 7 and 6 together = 13; write 3 as the next figure, carry
1 to add to the sum of 8 and 5, and so on.</p>

<p>The reason for dividing the figures in each square by a
diagonal line, and for placing the left-hand figure higher
than the right is, that the eye may be thus assisted in adding
the carried figure of one slip to the unit of the next.</p>

<p>To provide for the occurrence of more than one of the same
figures in the multiplicand, there should be several slips or
rods for each of the digits.</p>

<p>In practice the rods are placed on a flat piece of wood,
with two ridges at right angles, by which they are preserved
in a proper position.</p>

<p>This instrument can be made useful in "divisions," by
making by means of it a table of the product of the divisor,
multiplied by each of the numbers 1 to 9.</p>


<p class="p6">THE ARITHMETICAL BOOMERANG.</p>

<p>The boomerang is an instrument of peculiar form, used
by the natives of New South Wales, for the purpose of
killing wild fowl and other small animals. If projected forwards,
it at first proceeds in a straight line, but afterwards
rises in the air, and after performing sundry peculiar gyrations,
returns in the direction of the place where it was
thrown.</p>

<p>The term is applied to those arithmetical processes by
which you can divine a number thought of by another. You
throw forwards the number by means of addition and multiplication,
and then, by means of subtraction and division,
you bring it back to the original starting point, making it
proceed in a track so circuitous as to evade the superficial
notice of the tyro.</p>


<p class="p6">TO FIND A NUMBER THOUGHT OF.</p>

<p><em>First Method.</em></p>

<p>This is an arithmetical trick which, to those who are unacquainted
with it, seems very surprising; but, when explained,
it is very simple. For instance, ask a person to
<em>think</em> of any number under 10. When he says he has done
so, desire him to treble that number. Then ask him whether
the sum of the number he has thought of (now multiplied
by 3) be odd or even; if odd, tell him to add 1 to make the
sum even. He is next to halve the sum, and then treble
that half. Again ask whether the amount be odd or even.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
If odd, add 1 (as before) to make it even, and then halve it.
Now ask how many nines are contained in the remainder.
The secret is, to bear in mind whether the first sum be odd
or even; if odd, retain 1 in the memory; if odd a second
time, retain 2 more (making in all 3 to be retained in the
memory;) to which add 4 for every nine contained in the remainder.</p>

<p>For example, No. 7 is odd the first and also the second
time; and the remainder (17) contains one nine; so that
1, added to 2, make 3, and 3, added to 4, make 7, the number
thought of. No. 1 is odd the first time (retain 1), and
even the second (of which no notice is taken), but the remainder
is not equal to nine. No. 2 is even the first and odd
the second time (retain 2), but the remainder contains no
nine. No. 3 is odd the first and the second time, still there
is no nine in the remainder. No. 4 is even both times, and
contains one nine. No. 5 is odd the first time and the remainder
contains one nine. No. 6 is odd the second time,
and contains one nine in the remainder. No. 8 is even both
times, and the remainder contains two nines. No notice
need be taken of any overplus of a remainder, after being
divided by nine.</p>

of them, and to tell you the number so transferred. Suppose
it be 4, the hands now contain 4 and 12. Ask him how many
times the smaller number is contained in the larger; in this
case it is 3 times. You must then multiply the number
transferred, 4, by the 3, making 12, and add the 4, making
16; then divide 16 by the 3 <em>minus</em> 1; this will bring 8, the
number in each hand.</p>

<p>In most cases fractions will occur in the process: when
10 counters are in each hand, and if 4 be transferred, the
hands will contain 6 and 14.</p>

<p>He will divide 14 by 6 and inform you that the quotient is
2<span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>/</span><sub>6</sub></span> or 2<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>3</sub></span>.</p>

<p>He need not inform you that 48 is the figure produced, but
he must let you know in which of the four halvings he was
obliged to take a "larger half;" having ascertained this
point, you discover the number fixed upon in the following
manner. Carry in your mind, or on a slip of paper, the following
list of names in which the letter a occurs in one or
more of the three syllables of all except the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>The three syllables are intended to represent the 1st, 2d,
and 3d halvings, and the occurrence of the letter <span class="smcapa">A</span> corresponds
to the occurrence of a "larger half" in one or more
of these three halvings. Having been informed where the
<em>larger half</em> was taken, refer to the word which has <span class="smcapa">A</span> in the
corresponding syllable, and against it stand two numbers,
one of which was the number thought of; and of these two,
the right hand number is the correct one <em>if a larger half was
taken in the</em> 4<em>th stage</em>, and the left hand one <em>if the</em>, 4<em>th halving
was exact</em>.</p>

<p>In the example given, a <em>larger half</em> occurred in the 1st
and 3d stage; this points us to <em>Car-ro-way</em>, and the halving
in the 4th stage being exact, shows us that 8 was the number
fixed upon.</p>

<p>It will be observed that there is always a difference of 8
between the numbers of the columns, so that it is necessary
to recollect only one of them. Perhaps some of our readers
who wish to be adepts in this game, would prefer recollecting
the above table if put in this form:</p>

<blockquote><p>2-3 &nbsp; 1-2 &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; 1-2-3 &nbsp; 1-3 &nbsp; 2 <span class="mleft0">&nbsp;</span>none<br />

<p>where the upper line denotes the cases in which the "larger
half" was taken, and the lower line the numbers of the
left hand column above given.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Another Method.</em></p>

<p>The person having chosen any number from one to fifteen,
he is to add twenty-one to that number, and triple the
amount. Then,</p>

<p>1st. He is to take half of that triple, and triple that half.</p>

<p>2nd. To take the half of the last triple, and triple that
half.</p>

<p>3rd. To take the half of the last triple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>4th. To take the half of the last half.</p>

<p>In this operation there are four distinct cases or stages
where the half is to be taken. The three first are denoted
by one of the eight following Latin words, each word being
composed of three syllables, and the syllables containing the
letter i corresponding in numerical order with the cases
where the half cannot be taken without a fraction; consequently,
in those cases the person who makes the deduction
is to add one to the number to be divided. The fourth case
shows which of the two numbers corresponding to each
word has been chosen. For if the fourth half can be taken
without adding one, the number chosen is in the first, or
left-hand column; but if not, it is in the second column to
the right.</p>

<p>Here we see, that in the second and third case, one had
to be added, and, looking at the table, we find that the only
corresponding word having an i in its second and third
syllables is <em>Ob-tin-git</em>, which represents the figures one and
nine. Then, as one had to be added in the fourth case, we
know by the rule, that the figure in the second column, 9,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
is the one required. Observe, that if no addition be required
at any of the four stages, the number thought of
will be fifteen; and if one addition only be required at the
fourth stage, the number will be seven.</p>


<p class="p6">WHO WEARS THE RING?</p>

<p>This is an elegant application of the principles involved
in discovering a number fixed upon. The number of persons
participating in the game should not exceed nine.
One of them puts a ring on one of his fingers, and it is
your object to discover&mdash;1st. The wearer of the ring. 2d.
The hand. 3d. The finger. 4th. The joint.</p>

<p>The company being seated in order the persons must be
numbered 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.; the thumb must be termed the first
finger, the fore finger being the second; the joint nearest
the extremity must be called the first joint; the right hand
is one, and the left hand two.</p>

<p>These preliminaries having been arranged, leave the
room in order that the ring may be placed unobserved by
you. We will suppose that the third person has the ring
on the right hand, third finger, and first joint; your object
is to discover the figures 3131.</p>

<p>When we look around us at results happening daily, of
the causes of which we are ignorant, we are led to regard
them as isolated incidents subject to no law or rule; but
could we see and understand the secret workings and connection
existing between cause and effect, we might frequently
discover that all works by rule. As it is, we may
readily mark the boundaries, within which events must
happen in very many instances; and do much to estimate
their probability. We speak of <em>Chance</em>, as something without
plan or design, but taking in a large range, our calculations
will approximate closely to the truth. When we
throw a copper into the air, the chances of "heads or tails,"
as the boys say, are equal, and though one or the other may
occur most frequently for a few throws, in a large number,
say a thousand, the results will be about equally divided.
In this case the sides of the coin must be equal in weight,
else it will be like the grumbler's bread and butter:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"I never had a piece of bread,</div>
  <div class="i1">Particularly good and wide,</div>
  <div class="i0">But fell upon the sanded floor,</div>
  <div class="i1">And always on the buttered side."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Had he put on less butter, perhaps the sides would have
been more equal in weight, and the probability of the buttered
side being uppermost would have been increased.
Disturbing causes unknown to us, may often shape the
result; but in the absence of these, we may pretty accurately
estimate our chances.</p>

<p>We see accidents from fire and flood, happening at times
and points least expected; but the insurer has learned by
observation to estimate probabilities, and by taking a wide
range of country and a period of years, he does a comparatively
safe business. Death takes the young and the old;
but the life insurer has conned the bills of mortality and
studied the ages of those who have died, until he can estimate
at once the probability of duration of life, and determine
what he can afford to pay for an annuity contingent
on life, or engage for a present sum, or an annual sum paid
for life, to pay the heirs at the death of the insured. In
one instance his estimate may fall short, and in another
exceed, but the average will be about right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>So, too, the man who deals in lotteries and games of chance,
knows the data and calculates carefully the probabilities,
and though "luck" may sometimes be against him, his estimates
of probabilities are based on mathematical principles,
and he is secure in being ultimately the gaining party.</p>

<p>How these chances are calculated, depends on the data
in each case, and it is not within the range of our present
plan to attempt more than giving a general idea of the
subject; and this with any one of ordinary prudence, will
be sufficient to prevent all intermeddling with lotteries and
every other species of gambling. The probabilities are always
against the casual operator, even if all be conducted fairly;
what then must they be when fraud and dishonesty are
superadded? It is downright swindling!</p>

<p>In lottery schemes generally, fifteen per cent. is reserved
as profit, but this is a small part of what may be secured;
yet even this amounts to a great deal. If a man were to
draw a prize nominally of $100,000, fifteen thousand would
be deducted at once, and he would be entitled to only $85,000.
It is true that in his good fortune he would not probably regard
the abatement, but that does not change the principle.</p>


<p class="p6">VARIATIONS.</p>

<p>It is obvious that if we have a number of single things
arranged in any order, we may change the arrangement
into a variety of forms, and in doing so, we may take all
together, or we may take only part at once. For instance,
we may arrange the six vowels, a e, i, o, u, y, in a great
number of ways, as a e i o u y, a i e o u y, e a i o u y,
&amp;c., &amp;c.; or we may form them into groups, as ae, io, uy, ai,
eu, oy, &amp;c.; or, we may take three, four, five, or, as above,
all at a time; and it is reasonable to suppose that the number
of possible changes may, in all cases, be calculated.</p>

<p>When all are taken together, the operation is called
<em>Permutation</em>; but if a part only be taken, it is called either
a <em>Variation</em> or a <em>Combination</em>; a e, i o, u y, are distinct combinations,
and are also considered one of the variations of
two of which those six letters are susceptible; e a, o i, y u,
are three other variations, but they are the same combinations;
for a change of order will constitute a new variation
but not a new combination; hence the number of variations
will always exceed the number of combinations.</p>

<p>The doctrine of variations and combinations forms the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
basis of many forms of lotteries, and of other calculations
used in practical life.</p>


<p class="p6">COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS.</p>

<p>"Combinations" are the different ways in which a certain
number of things can be selected out of a larger number,
when taken 1 at a time, 2 at a time, or any other number
each time, but without regard to the order in which the
selected numbers can be arranged among themselves. The
latter is the province of "Permutation," which refers to the
different ways in which a number can be selected out of
one that is larger, and, <em>in addition to this</em>, to the different
ways of <em>grouping</em> these selected numbers.</p>

<p>Thus 4 things can be taken 2 at a time in 6 different ways;
for instance, the letters a, b, c, d, can be taken 2 at a time
thus, a and b, a and c, a and d, b and c, b and d, c and d;
if we regard the <em>order</em> of the selected letters we shall find
that these 4 letters are capable of 12 different permutations,
as ab, ba, ac, ca, ad, da, bc, cb, bd, db, cd, dc.</p>

<p>If we selected 3 letters at a time we could make 4 different
selections, and 24 different changes of grouping.</p>

<p>The rule to compute the number of these different ways
is very simple, but sometimes involves a multitude of
figures.</p>

<p>To determine the number of permutations, commence
with unity, and multiply by the successive terms of the
natural series 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., until the highest multiplier shall
express the number of individual things. The last product
will indicate the number of possible changes.</p>

<p><em>Example 1.</em> How many changes can be made in the arrangement
of 5 grains of corn, all of different colors, laid in
a row?</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Solution.</em> 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120, <em>Ans.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This may seem improbable, the number being so great,
but if there were but a single grain more, the possible
changes would be 720; and another would extend the limit
to 5040; and so onward in a constantly increasing ratio.
The reason, however, will be obvious on a little <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'scrunity'">scrutiny</ins>. If
there were but one thing, as <em>a</em>, it would admit of but one
position; but if two, as <em>a b</em>, it would admit of two positions,
<em>ab</em>, <em>ba</em>. If three things, as <em>a b c</em>, then they will admit of
1 × 2 × 3 = 6 changes, for the last two will admit of two
variations, as <em>a b c</em>, <em>a c b</em>, and each of the three may successively
be placed first, and two changes made to each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the others, so that 3 × 2 = 6, the number of possible changes.
In the same way we may show that if there be four individual
things, each one will be first in each of the six
changes which the other three will undergo, and consequently,
there will be 24 changes in all. In this way we
might show that when there are 5 individual things, there
will be 5 times as many changes as when there were but 4;
and when 6, there will be 6 times as many changes as when
there are only 5; and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>, according to the
same law.</p>

<p><em>Example 2.</em> In how many ways may a family of 10 persons
seat themselves differently at dinner? <em>Ans.</em> 3,628,800.</p>

<p>When we consider that this would require a period of
9935-55/487 years, the mind is lost in astonishment. The story
of the man who bought a horse at a farthing for the first
nail in his shoe, a penny for the second, &amp;c., is thrown into
the shade; and we incline to doubt whether there is not
some mistake; and yet on just such chances as one to all
these, do gamblers constantly risk their money!</p>

<p><em>Example 3.</em> I have written the letters contained in the
word N I M R O D on 6 cards; being one letter on each,
and having thrown them confusedly into a hat, I am offered
$10 to draw the cards successively, so as to spell the name
correctly. What is my chance of success worth? <em>Ans.</em> 1 <span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><span>/</span><sub>18</sub></span>
cents.</p>

<p><em>Example 4.</em> In order to form a lottery scheme, I have put
into the wheel as many cards as I can put 4 letters of the
word Charleston on, without having the same letters in the
same order upon any two cards. I offer $100 to him who
draws the card having on it the first four letters of the said
word in their natural order (Char). What is the chance
of drawing a prize worth?</p>

<p>There are 10 letters in the word, and the combination is
of the 4th class; and, according to the mode of determining
combinations with repetitions, we find the whole number
of combinations of the 4th class which the word admits
of is 210. Then he has one chance in 210 of drawing the
letters Char, in <em>some</em> order. The number of permutations of
four individual things is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24, and 210 × 24 = 5040
his chance of drawing them in the right order, and $100
divided by 5040 gives <em>Ans.</em> 1 <span class="frac"><sup>52</sup><span>/</span><sub>63</sub></span> cents.</p>

<p>Suppose that the numbers from 1 to 78, inclusive, be
placed upon 78 cards, and the cards placed in a wheel by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
which they are thoroughly mixed; and then 13 cards be
successively drawn out, by a person who has no means of
choosing, and the numbers on them registered. Suppose
also that tickets have been issued, containing each three of
the 78 numbers, but no two having <em>all</em> the same numbers,
and that he who holds the ticket having on it the first three
drawn numbers in their regular order, shall be entitled to
$100,000; what would the probability of drawing such a
ticket be worth?</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Ans.</em> 21 <span class="frac"><sup>5183</sup><span>/</span><sub>5858</sub></span> cents.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;It is usual also, to give smaller prizes to the holders
of tickets having the numbers in any order, or having
any two or one of the drawn numbers. Lotteries may be
arranged on a great diversity of plans, and in each the probability
of drawing prizes will vary.</p>

<p>A speaks the truth 3 times in 4; B 4 times in 5, and C 6
times in 7. What is the probability of an event which A
and B assert, and C denies? <em>Ans.</em> <span class="frac"><sup>140</sup><span>/</span><sub>143</sub></span></p>

<p>Suppose a coin be thrown up, having two faces; what is
the probability that the obverse (heads) side will fall upward,
and what the reverse?</p>

<p>Here there are only two possible cases, and one favors each
of the contingencies the probability of each will be <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>(1 + 1)</sub></span> = <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>2</sub></span>;
there being no reason why one side should fall uppermost
rather than the other.</p>

<p>What would be the probability of either side presenting
upwards twice in two throws?</p>

<p>Here we have 4 possible cases, viz.:</p>

<blockquote><p>Obverse and reverse;<br />
Obverse both times;<br />
Reverse and obverse;<br />
Reverse both times.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the 4 possibilities there is only one which favors the
turning up of the obverse twice in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'successsion'">succession</ins>, and the
same is true of the reverse, hence the probability of either
is only <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>4</sub></span>.</p>

<p>In like manner we might show that the probability of the
obverse presenting upwards three times in succession will
be <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>8</sub></span>, or <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>2</sub></span> × <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>2</sub></span> × <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>2;</sub></span> the general principle being to multiply
successively together the independent probabilities of an
event for the fraction expressing the chance of all the events
happening.</p>

<p class="p6">THE VISITORS TO THE CRYSTAL PALACE.</p>

<p>In a family consisting of 8 young people, it was agreed
that 3 at a time should visit the Crystal Palace, and that
the visit should be repeated each day as long as a different
trio could be selected. In how many days were the possible
combinations of 3 out of 8 completed?</p>

<p>We must multiply 8 × 7 × 6, and also 3 × 2 × 1, and divide
the product of the former, 336, by the product of the latter,
6; the result is 56, the number of visits, a different three
going each time. So much gratified were they with the results
of their agreement, that they wished to be allowed
another series of visits, to be continued as many days as
they could group 3 together in different order when starting.
If Paterfamilias had granted such permission he would have
had to wait 56 multiplied by 3 × 2 × 1, or 336 days, before
this "new series" of visits would have come to a <em>finis</em>.</p>


<p class="p6">HOW MANY CHANGES CAN BE GIVEN TO 7 NOTES OF A PIANO?</p>

<p>That is to say, in how many ways can 7 keys be struck
in succession, so that there shall be some difference in the
order of the notes each time?</p>

<p>The result of multiplying</p>

<p class="center">7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1</p>

<p>is 5,040, the number of changes.</p>


<p class="p6">THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE.</p>

<p>This name has been given to a contrivance said to have
originated with the famous Pascal, or to have been perfected
by him.</p>

<blockquote><p>1<br />
2   1<br />
3   3   1<br />
4   6   4  1<br />
5  10  10  5  1<br />
6  15  20 15  6  1<br />
7  21  35 35 21  7  1<br />
8  28  56 70 56 28  8  1<br />
&amp;c. <span class="mleft4">&nbsp;</span>&amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>This peculiar series of numbers is thus formed: Write
down the numbers 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., as far as you please, in a vertical
row. On the right hand of 2 place 1, add them together,
and place 3 under the 1; then 3 added to 3 = 6, which place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
under the 3; 4 and 6 are 10, which place under the 6, and
so on as far as you wish. This is the second vertical row,
and the third is formed from the second in a similar way.</p>

<p>This triangle has the property of informing us, without
the trouble of calculation, how many combinations can be
made, taking any number at a time out of a larger number.</p>

<p>Suppose the question were that just given; how many
selections can be made of 3 at a time out of 8? On the
horizontal row commencing with 8, look for the third number;
this is 56, which is the answer.</p>


<p class="p6">HOW MANY DIFFERENT DEALS CAN BE MADE WITH 13 CARDS OUT OF 52?</p>

<p>To discover this we must make a continued multiplication
of 52 × 51 × 50 × 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44 × 43 × 42 × 41 × 40,
being 13 terms for the 13 cards, also a continued multiplication
of 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, and
having found the two products, we must divide one by the
other, and the quotient is the number of different deals out
of 52 cards. This "sum," that looks so formidable with
natural figures, is a very short one by logarithms.</p>


<p class="p6">THE THREE GRACES.</p>

<p>Three articles, or three names inscribed on cards, having
been distributed between three persons, you are to tell
which article or card each person has.</p>

<p>Designate the three persons in your own mind, as 1st, 2d,
and 3d, and the three articles, <span class="smcapa">A</span>, <span class="smcapa">E</span>, <span class="smcapa">I</span>. Provide 24 counters,
and give 1 to the first person, 2 to the 2d, 3 to the 3d.
Place the remaining 18 on the table. Request that the
three persons will distribute among themselves the three
articles, and that, having done so, the person who has the
one which you have secretly denoted by <span class="smcapa">A</span>, will take as many
counters as he may have already; the holder of <span class="smcapa">E</span> must take
twice as many as he may have; and the holder of <span class="smcapa">I</span> must
take four times as many. Then leave the room, in order
that the distribution of articles and of counters may be made
unobserved by you. We will suppose that the three articles
are three cards, on which are the words Clara, Rosa, Emily,
which you will yourself secretly denote by the letters <span class="smcapa">A</span>, <span class="smcapa">E</span>, <span class="smcapa">I</span>.
Suppose also that in the division the first person has Emily
(<span class="smcapa">I</span>), the second has Clara (<span class="smcapa">A</span>), and the third has Rosa (<span class="smcapa">E</span>),
then the 1st will take four times as many counters as he has
(1), and will therefore take 4; the 2d will take as many as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
he has (2), and will therefore take 2; the 3d will take 6,
being twice as many as he has (3). On the table will be
left 6 counters. The distribution having been made, you
will return and observe the number of counters on the table,
from which you can find who is the holder of each card by
the following method.</p>

<p>It is plain that if the cards held by the 1st and 2d can be
told, that held by the 3d will be known. It will be found
that only six numbers can remain, viz. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7; never
4, and never more than 7. Now the 6 combinations of a, e,
and i, here given, represent the articles held by the 1st and
2d persons.</p>

<p>In the case supposed, 6 counters being on the table, the
combination <em>ia</em> indicates that the first person has the card
you have called <span class="smcapa">I</span> (Emily), the 2d has <span class="smcapa">A</span> (Clara), so that the
3d has <span class="smcapa">E</span> (Rosa).</p>

<p>In order to recollect the combinations of <span class="smcapa">A</span>, <span class="smcapa">E</span>, and <span class="smcapa">I</span>, it will

<p>A sharp youth, fresh from school, having gone to visit a
good-natured uncle, the latter placed on a table fifteen fine
oranges and fifteen apples, and desired his young friend to
take half. He, not liking the apples, was about to take the
fifteen oranges; but this monopoly of the best fruit being
objected to, the old gentleman told him to range all the
fruit in a circle, and to take every ninth. The clever fellow
ranged them in such a way as that, by taking away
every ninth, all the apples were left on the table, and all the
oranges were transferred to his capacious pockets. How did
he arrange them?</p>

<p>The object of the game is to guess which of the words
from any of the <em>selecting cards</em> any person may have fixed
upon.</p>

<p>Let any one choose a card out of the <em>selecting cards</em>, and
after he has fixed upon a word, give it back to you; when
receiving it, carefully note the last word upon it, which will
give you, by the aid of the key word, the number of the
card; this you must keep secret, and you then give him all
the <em>grouped cards</em>, and request him to show you the cards
which contain the words he fixed upon.</p>

<p>You can then announce the word; for the number of the
word from the top on the grouped card is the same as the
number of the selecting card, from which he made his
choice.</p>

<p>Suppose he made his choice from the card which has
Theodore for its last word&mdash;this is No. 4; when he shows
you the grouped card, which he says contains the selected
word, you will know that Ralph, the fourth from the top, is
the name he fixed upon.</p>

<p class="p6">THE THREE TRAVELERS.</p>

<p>Three men met at a caravansary or inn, in Persia; and
two of them brought their provision along with them, according
to the custom of the country; but the third not
having provided any, proposed to the others that they should
eat together, and he would pay the value of his proportion.
This being agreed to, A produced 5 loaves, and B 3 loaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
all of which the travelers ate together, and C paid 8 pieces
of money as the value of his share, with which the others
were satisfied, but quarreled about the division of it. Upon
this the matter was referred to the judge, who decided impartially.
What was his decision?</p>

<p>At first sight it would seem that the money should be divided
according to the bread furnished; but we must consider
that, as the 3 ate 8 loaves, each one ate 2-2/3 loaves of
the bread he furnished. This from 5 would leave 2-1/3 loaves
furnished the stranger by A; and 3 - 2-2/3 = 1/3 furnished by B,
hence 2-1/3 to 1/3 = 7 to 1, is the ratio in which the money is to
be divided. If you imagine A and B to furnish, and C to
consume all, then the division will be according to amounts
furnished.</p>

<p>Desire a person to think of one of the numbers, and to
tell you in which row it is. Suppose he fixes on 6; he will
tell you that the row A contains the number he thought of.</p>

<p>Take up the row A, and arrange the numbers on each side
of the row B, as shown at C D, so that the first number of
the row A may be the first of the row C, the second of A be
the first of D, the third of A be the second of C, and so on.</p>

<p>Ask in which of the rows, C or D, is the number thought
of: in the case supposed it is in D.</p>

<p>Take up the rows C D, and put one underneath the other,
as at M, taking care that the half-row in which is the number
thought of, shall be above the other.</p>

<p>Divide it again into two rows, as at E F, on each side of
B, in the same way as before. Ask again in which row it
is: it is now in E.</p>

<p>You will be informed that the number is in row H, and you
may then announce it to be the top number of that row.</p>

<p>The number thought of will always be <em>at the top of one of

it would be at the top after four transpositions.</p>


<p class="p6">MAGIC SQUARES.</p>

<p>The name "Magic Square" is given to a square divided
into several smaller squares, in which numbers are placed
in such a manner that every column of numbers, whether
vertical, horizontal, or from corner to corner, shall amount
to the same sum.</p>

<p>They are divided into three principal classes: 1st, Those
which have an odd number of squares in each band; 2d,
Those which have an even number of squares in each band,
this even number being divisible exactly by 4; 3d, Where
the even number of squares in each band cannot be divided
by 4 without a fraction.</p>


<p class="p6">ODD MAGIC SQUARES.</p>

<p>Squares of this kind are formed thus. Imagine an exterior
line of squares above the magic square you wish to
form, and another exterior line on the right hand of it
These two imaginary lines are shown in the figure.</p>

<p>Then attend to the two following rules:</p>

<p>1st. In placing the numbers in the squares we must go
in an ascending oblique direction from left to right; any
number which, by pursuing this direction, would fall into
the exterior line, must be carried along that line of squares,
whether vertical or horizontal, to the last square. Thus, 1
having been placed in the center of the top line, (see the
first table on p. 228,) 2 would fall into the exterior square
above the fourth vertical line; it must be therefore carried
down to the lowest square of that line; then, ascending
obliquely 3 falls into the square, but four falls out of it, to
the end of a horizontal line, and it must be carried along that
line to the extreme left, and there placed. Resuming our
oblique ascension to the right, we place 5, where the reader
sees it, and would place 6 in the middle of the top band,
but finding it occupied by 1, we look for direction to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
2d Rule, which prescribes that, when in ascending
obliquely, we come to a square already occupied, we must
place the number, which according to the first rule should
go into that occupied square, directly under the last number
placed. Thus, in ascending with 4, 5, 6, the 6 must be
placed directly under the 5, because the square next to 5 in
an oblique direction is "engaged."</p>

<p>Magic squares of this class, however large in the number
of compartments, can be easily filled up by attending to
these two rules.</p>

<p>We give opposite, a seven-placed square.</p>

<p>There are various other kinds of magic squares; but explanations
of them would be too lengthy for our work.</p>

<p>The invention of these contrivances has been traced
back to the early ages of science, and talismanic properties
were attributed to them. Modern philosophers have amused
themselves in bringing them to perfection, and none has
contributed so much as "the model of practical wisdom,"
Dr. Franklin.</p>


<p class="p6">THE SQUARE OF GOTHAM.</p>

<p>The wise men of Gotham, famous for their eccentric blunders,
once undertook the management of a school; they
arranged their establishment in the form of a square divided
into 9 rooms. The playground occupied the center, and
24 scholars the rooms around it, 3 being in each. In spite
of the strictness of discipline, it was suspected that the boys
were in the habit of playing truant, and it was determined
to set a strict watch. To assure themselves that all the
boys were on the premises, they visited the rooms, and found
three in each, or 9 in each row. Four boys then went out,
and the wise men soon after visited the rooms, and finding
9 in each row, thought all was right. The four boys then
came back, accompanied by four strangers; and the Gothamites,
on their third round, finding still 9 in each row,
entertained no suspicion of what had taken place. Then 4
more "chums" were admitted; but the clever men, on examining
the establishment a fourth time, still found 9 in
each row, and so came to an opinion that their previous
suspicions had been unfounded. How was all this possible?</p>

<p>The following figures represent the contents of each room
at the four different visits; the first, at the commencement
of the watch; the second, when four had gone out; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
third, when these 4, accompanied by another 4, had returned;
and the fourth, when 4 more had joined them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_230.jpg" width="500" height="144" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On each change the boys arranged themselves in the
rooms in such a manner that, when the corner rooms were
counted as a part of two rows, each entire row of three
rooms contained the same number of boys. The illusion of
the wise men was due to their mistake in counting each
corner room twice.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MATHEMATICAL BLACKSMITH.</p>

<p>A blacksmith had a stone weighing 40 lbs. A mason coming
into the shop, hammer in hand, struck it and broke it
into four pieces. "There," says the smith, "you have ruined
my weight." "No," says the mason, "I have made it better,
for whereas you could before weigh but 40 lbs. with it,
now you can weigh every pound from 1 to 40." Required
size of the pieces?</p>

<p><em>Ans.</em> 1, 3, 9, 27; for in any geometrical series proceeding
in a triple ratio, each term is 1 more than twice the sum of
all the preceding, and the above series might proceed to
any extent. In using the weights, they must be put in one
or both scales as may be necessary: as to weigh 2, put 1
in one scale, and 3 in the other.</p>


<p class="p6">CURIOUS PROPERTIES OF SOME FIGURES.</p>

<p>Select any two numbers you please, and you will find
that one of the two, their amount when added together, or
their difference, is always 3, or a number divisible by 3.</p>

<p>Thus, if the numbers are 3 and 8, the first number is 3;
let the numbers be 1 and 2, their sum is 3; let them be 4
and 7, the difference is 3. Again, 15 and 22, the first number
is divisible by 3: 17 and 26, their difference is divisible
by 3, &amp;c.</p>

<p>All the odd numbers above 3, that can only be divided
by 1, can be divided by 6, by the addition or subtraction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
a unit. For instance, 13 can only be divided by 1; but
after deducting 1, the remainder can be divided by 6; for
example, 5 + 1 = 6 ; 7 - 1 = 6; 17 + 1 = 18; 19 - 1 = 18; 25
- 1 = 24, and so on.</p>

<p>If you multiply 5 by itself, and the quotient again by
itself, and the second quotient by itself, the last figure of
each quotient will always be 5. Thus 5 × 5 = 25; 25 × 25 =
125; 125 × 125 = 625, &amp;c. Again, if you proceed in the
same manner with the figure 6, the last figure will constantly
be 6; thus, 6 × 6 = 36; 36 × 36 = 216; 216 × 216 =
1,296, and so on.</p>

<p>To multiply by 2 is the same as to multiply by 10 and
divide by 5.</p>

<p>Any number of figures you may wish to multiply by 5,
will give the same result if divided by 2&mdash;a much quicker
operation than the former; but you must remember to annex
a cipher to the answer where there is no remainder,
and where there is a remainder, annex a 5 to the answer.
Thus, multiply 464 by 5, the answer will be 2320; divide
the same number by 2, and you have 232, and as there is
no remainder you add a cipher. Now, take 357, and multiply
by 5&mdash;the answer is 1785. On dividing 357 by 2,
there is 178, and a remainder; you therefore place 5 at the
right of the line, and the result is again 1785.</p>

<p>There is something more curious in the properties of the
number 9. Any number multiplied by 9 produces a sum of
figures which, added together, continually makes 9. For
example, all the first multiples of 9, as 18, 27, 36, 45, 54,
63, 72, 81, sum up 9 each. Each of them multiplied by
any number whatever produces a similar result; as 8 times
81 are 648, these added together make 18, 1 and 8 are 9.
Multiply 648 by itself, the product is 419,904&mdash;the sum of
these digits is 27, 2 and 7 are 9. The rule is invariable.
Take any number whatever and multiply it by 9; or any
multiple of 9, and the sum will consist of figures which,
added together, continually number 9. As 17 × 18 = 306,
6 and 3 are 9; 117 × 27 = 3,159, the figures sum up 18, 8
and 1 are 9; 4591 × 72 = 330,552, the figures sum up 18, 8
and 1 are 9. Again, 87,363 × 54 = 4,717,422; added together
the product is 27, or 2 and 7 are 9, and so always. If any
row of two or more figures be reversed and subtracted
from itself, the figures composing the remainder, will, when
added horizontally, be a multiple of nine:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>42 <span class="mleft4">&nbsp;</span>886 <span class="mleft4a">&nbsp;</span>326<br />
24 <span class="mleft4">&nbsp;</span>688 <span class="mleft4">&nbsp;</span>1623<br />
&mdash; <span class="mleft4">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash; <span class="mleft3a">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash;<br />
18 &ndash; 9 × 2. <span class="mleft0">&nbsp;</span>198 &ndash; 9 × 2. <span class="mleft0a">&nbsp;</span>1638 &ndash; 9 × 2.</p></blockquote>

<p>If a multiplicand be formed of the digits in their regular
order, omitting the 8, a multiplier may be found by a rule,
which will give a product, each figure of which shall be the
same. Thus if 12345679 be given, and it be required to
find a multiplier which shall give the product all in 2, that
multiplier will be 18: if in 3, the multiplier will be 27: if
all 4, it will be 36&mdash;and so forth.</p>

<blockquote><p> &nbsp;12345679 &nbsp;12345679 &nbsp;12345679<br />
<span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span>18 <span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span>27 <span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span>36<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;98765432 &nbsp; 86419753 &nbsp; 74074074<br />
12345679 &nbsp; 24691358 &nbsp; 37037037<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
222222222  333333333  444444444</p></blockquote>

<p>The rule by which the multiplier is discovered (but
which we do not attempt to explain) is this: Multiply the
last figure (the 9) of the multiplicand by the figure of
which you wish the product to be composed, and that number
will be the required multiplier. Thus, when it was
required to have the product composed of 2, the 2 multiplied
by 9 gives 18, the multiplier: 3 multiplied by 9 gives
27, the multiplier to give the product in 3; &amp;c.</p>

<p>If a figure, with a number of ciphers attached to it, be
divided by 9, the quotient will be composed of one figure
only, namely, the first figure of the dividend, as&mdash;</p>

<p>9)600,000 <span class="mleft4">&nbsp;</span>9)40,000<br />
<span class="mleft0a">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; <span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="mleft1">&nbsp;</span>66,666&ndash;6 <span class="mleft4a">&nbsp;</span>4,444&ndash;4</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="mleft18">&nbsp;</span>{ &nbsp; 9)549<br />
If any sum of figures can be divided by 9 as, &nbsp;{&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="mleft18">&nbsp;</span>{ <span class="mleft1a">&nbsp;</span>61</p></blockquote>

<p>the amount of these figures, when added together, can be
divided by 9:&mdash;thus, 5, 4, 9, added together, make 18,
which is divisible by 9. If the sum 549 is multiplied by
any figure, the product can also be divided by 9, as&mdash;</p>

<p>If number 37 be multiplied by any of the progressive

37 × 6 = 222; 37 × 12 = 444; 37 × 24 =

3 was multiplied to obtain the respective progressive
numbers. Thus&mdash;3 multiplied by 2 is equal to 6, and 37

<p class="p6">THE COUNCIL OF TEN.</p>

<p>Ten cards or counters, numbered from one to ten, or the
first ten playing cards of any suit disposed in a circular
form may be employed with great convenience for performing
this feat. The accompanying figure shows the cards
thus arranged, number one, or the ace, designated by A,
and the ten by K.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_235.jpg" width="312" height="157" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Having placed the cards in the above order, desire a
bystander to think of a card or number, and when he has
done so, to touch any other card or number. Request him
then to add to the number of the card touched the number
of the cards employed, which in this case is ten. Then
desire him to count the sum in an order contrary to that of
the natural numbers, beginning at the card he touched, and
assigning it the number of the card he thought of. By
counting in this manner, he will end at the number or card
he thought of, and consequently you will immediately
know it.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, suppose the person had thought of 3 C,
and touched 6 F; then, if 10 be added to 6, the sum will
be 16; and if that number be counted from F, the number
touched, towards E D B C A, and so on, in the retrograde
order, counting F three, the number thought of, E five, D
six, and so round to sixteen, that number will terminate at
C, showing that the person thought of 3, the number which
corresponds to C.</p>

<p>A greater or less number of cards or counters may be
employed at pleasure; but in every instance the whole
number of cards must be added to the number of the card
touched.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">When, lo! beside their path the foremost spies</div>
  <div class="i0">Three casks, and loud exclaims "A prize, a prize!"</div>
  <div class="i0">One large, two small, but all of various size.</div>
  <div class="i0">This way and that they gazed, and all around,</div>
  <div class="i0">Each wondering if an owner might be found:</div>
  <div class="i0">But not a soul was there&mdash;the coast was clear,</div>
  <div class="i0">So to the barrels they at once drew near,</div>
  <div class="i0">And both agree whatever may be there</div>
  <div class="i0">In friendly partnership they'll fairly share.</div>
  <div class="i0">Two they find empty, but the other full,</div>
  <div class="i0">And straightway from his pocket one doth pull</div>
  <div class="i0">A large clasp-knife. A heavy stone lay handy,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thus in time they found their prize was brandy.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis tasted and approved: their lips they smack,</div>

  <div class="i0">"Won't we have many a jolly night, my boy!</div>
  <div class="i0">May no ill luck our present hopes destroy!"</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas fortunate one knew the mathematics,</div>
  <div class="i0">And had a smattering of hydrostatics;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then measured he the casks, and said, "I see</div>
  <div class="i0">This is eight gallons, those are five and three."</div>
  <div class="i0">The question then was how they might divide</div>

  <div class="i0">At length a happy thought came o'er the brain</div>
  <div class="i0">Of one: 'twas done, and each went home content,</div>
  <div class="i0">And their good dames declared 'twas excellent.</div>
  <div class="i0">With those three casks they made division true;</div>
  <div class="i0">I found the puzzle out, say, friend, can you?</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The five-gallon barrel was filled first, and from that the
three-gallon barrel, thus leaving two gallons in the five-gallon
barrel; the three-gallon barrel was then emptied into
the eight-gallon barrel, and the two gallons poured from the
five-gallon barrel into the empty three-gallon barrel; the
five-gallon barrel was then filled, and one gallon poured into
the three-gallon barrel, therefore leaving four gallons in the
five-gallon barrel, one gallon in the eight-gallon barrel, and
three gallons in the three-gallon barrel, which was then
emptied into the eight-gallon barrel. Thus each person had
four gallons of brandy in the eight and five-gallon barrels

<p class="p6">THE MONEY GAME.</p>

<p>A person having in one hand a piece of gold, and in the
other a piece of silver, you may tell in which hand he has
the gold, and in which the silver, by the following method:
Some value, represented by an even number, such as 8,
must be assigned to the gold; and a value represented by
an odd number, such as three, must be assigned to the silver;
after which, desire the person to multiply the number
in the right hand by any even number whatever, such as 2,
and that in the left by an odd number, as 3; then bid him
add together the two products, and if the whole sum be odd,
the gold will be in the right hand, and the silver in the left;
if the sum be even, the contrary will be the case.</p>

<p>To conceal the artifice better, it will be sufficient to ask
whether the sum of the two products can be halved without
a remainder; for in that case the total will be even, and in
the contrary case odd.</p>

<p>It may be readily seen, that the pieces, instead of being
in the two hands of the same person, may be supposed to
be in the hands of two persons, one of whom has the even
number, or piece of gold, and the other the odd number, or
piece of silver. The same operations may then be performed
in regard to these two persons, as are performed in regard
to the two hands of the same person, calling the one privately
the right, and the other the left.</p>


<p class="p6">THE PHILOSOPHER'S PUPILS.</p>

<p>To find a number of which the half, fourth, and seventh
added to three shall be equal to itself.</p>

<p>This was a favorite problem among the ancient Grecian
arithmeticians, who stated the question in the following
manner: "Tell us, illustrious Pythagoras, how many pupils
frequent thy school?" "One half," replied the philosopher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
"study mathematics, one fourth natural philosophy,
one seventh observe silence, and there are three females
besides."</p>

<p>The answer is, 28: 14 + 7 + 4 + 3 = 28.</p>


<p class="p6">TO DISCOVER A SQUARE NUMBER.</p>

<p>A square number is a number produced by the multiplication
of any number into itself; thus, 4 multiplied by 4 is
equal to 16, and 16 is consequently a square number, 4 being
the square root from which it springs. The extraction of
the square root of any number takes some time; and after
all your labor you may perhaps find that the number is not
a square number. To save this trouble, it is worth knowing
that every square number ends either with a 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9,
or with two cyphers, preceded by one of these numbers.</p>

<p>Another property of a square number is, that if it be
divided by 4, the remainder, if any, will be 1&mdash;thus, the
square of 5 is 25, and 25 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of
1; and again, 16, being a square number, can be divided
by 4 without leaving a remainder.</p>


<p class="p6">THE SHEEP-FOLD.</p>

<p>A farmer had a pen made of 50 hurdles, capable of holding
100 sheep only; supposing he wanted to make it sufficiently
large to hold double that number, how many additional
hurdles would he have occasion for?</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>&mdash;Two. There were 24 hurdles on each side of the
pen; a hurdle at the top, and another at the bottom; so that,
by moving one of the sides a little back, and placing an additional
hurdle at the top and bottom, the size of the pen
would be exactly doubled.</p>


<p class="p6">COUNTRYWOMAN AND EGGS.</p>

<p>A countrywoman carried eggs to a garrison, where she had
three guards to pass, sold to the first guard half the number
she had, and half an egg more; to the second, the half of
what remained, and half an egg besides; and to the third
guard she sold the half of the remainder, and half another
egg. When she arrived at the market-place, she had three
dozen still to sell; how was this possible, without breaking
any of the eggs? It would seem at the first view that this
is impossible, for how can half an egg be sold without
breaking any of the eggs? The possibility of this seeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
impossibility will be evident, when it is considered, that by
taking the greater half of an odd number, we take the exact
half + 1/2. When the countrywoman passed the first guard,
she had 295 eggs; by selling to that guard 148, which is
the half + 1/2, she had 147 remaining; to the second guard
she disposed of 74, which is the major half of 147; and, of
of course, after selling 37 out of 74 to the last guard, she
had still three dozen remaining.</p>


<p class="p6">HOW TO RUB OUT TWENTY CHALKS AT FIVE TIMES, RUBBING OUT EVERY
TIME AN ODD ONE.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 84px;">
<img src="images/i_239.jpg" width="84" height="261" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To do this trick, you must make twenty chalks, or long
strokes, upon a board, as in the margin:</p>

<p>Then begin and count backwards, as 20, 19,
18, 17, rub out these four; then proceed saying,
16, 15, 14, 13, rub out these four; and begin
again, 12, 11, 10, 9, and rub out these;
and proceed again, 8, 7, 6, 5, then rub out
these; and lastly say, 4, 3, 2, 1, when these
four are rubbed out. The whole twenty are
rubbed out at five times, and every time an
odd one, that is, 17th, 13th, 9th, 5th, and
1st.</p>

<p>This is a trick which, if once seen, may be
easily retained; and the puzzle at first is, it
not occurring immediately to the mind to begin
to rub them out backwards. It is as simple as any
thing possibly can be.</p>


<p class="p6">THE IMPOSSIBLE TRIANGLE.</p>

<p>The longest side of a triangle is 100 rods; and each of
the other sides 50. Required the value of the grass at $5
per acre.</p>

<p>This is a catch question, as a triangle cannot be formed
unless any two of the lines are longer than the third.</p>


<p class="p6">ODD OR EVEN.</p>

<p>Every odd number multiplied by an odd number produces
an odd number; every odd number multiplied by an even
number produces an even number; and every even number
multiplied by an even number also produces an even number.
So, again, an even number added to an even number,
and an odd number added to an odd number, produce an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
even number; while an odd and even number added
together produce an odd number.</p>

<p>If any one holds an odd number of counters in one hand,
and an even number in the other, it is not difficult to discover
in which hand the odd or even number is. Desire the
party to multiply the number in the right hand by an even
number, and that in the left hand by an odd number, then
to add the two sums together, and tell you the last figure
of the product; if it is even, the odd number will be in the
right hand; and if odd, in the left hand; thus, supposing
there are 5 counters in the right hand, and 4 in the left hand,
multiply 5 by 2, and 4 by 3, thus: 5 × 2 = 10, 4 × 3 = 12, and
then adding 10 to 12, you have 10 + 12 = 22, the last figure
of which, 2, is even, and the odd number will consequently
be in the right hand.</p>

<p class="p6">THE OLD WOMAN AND HER EGGS.</p>

<p>At a time when eggs were scarce, an old woman who
possessed some remarkably good-laying hens, wishing to
oblige her neighbors, sent her daughter round with a basket
of eggs to three of them; at the first house, which was the
squire's, she left half the number of eggs she had and half
a one over; at the second she left half of what remained
and half an egg over; and at the third she again left half
of the remainder, and half a one over; she returned with
one egg in her basket, not having broken any. Required&mdash;the
number she set out with. <em>Ans.</em> 15 eggs.</p>

<p class="p6">THE DICE GUESSED UNSEEN.</p>

<p>A pair of dice being thrown, to find the number of points

the dice to double the number of points upon one of them,
and add 5 to it; then to multiply the sum produced by 5,
and to add to the product the number of points upon the other
die. This being done, desire him to tell you the amount,
and, having thrown out 25, the remainder will be a number
consisting of two figures, the first of which, to the left, is
the number of points on the first die, and the second figure,
to the right, the number on the other. Thus:</p>

<p>Suppose the number of points of the first die which comes
up to be 2, and that of the other 3; then, if to four, the
double of the points of the first, there be added 5, and the
sum produced, 9, be multiplied by 5, the product will be 45;
to which, if 3, the number of points on the other die, be
added, 48 will be produced, from which, if 25 be subtracted,
23 will remain; the first figure of which is 2, the number
of points on the first die, and the second figure 3, the
number on the other.</p>


<p class="p6">THE SOVEREIGN AND THE SAGE.</p>

<p>A sovereign being desirous to confer a liberal reward on
one of his courtiers, who had performed some very important
service, desired him to ask whatever he thought proper, assuring
him it should be granted. The courtier, who was well
acquainted with the science of numbers, only requested that
the monarch would give him a quantity of wheat equal to
that which would arise from one grain doubled sixty-three
times successively. The value of the reward was immense;
for it will be found by calculation that the
sixty-fourth term of the double progression divided
by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, &amp;c., is 9223372036854775808. But the
sum of all the terms of a double progression, beginning
with 1, may be obtained by doubling the last term, and subtracting
from it 1. The number of the grains of wheat, therefore,
in the present case, will be 18446744073709551615.
Now, if a pint contain 9216 grains of wheat, a gallon will contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
73728; and, as eight gallons make one bushel, if we divide
the above result by eight times 73728 we shall have
31274997411295 for the number of the bushels of wheat
equal to the above number of grains, a quantity greater than
what the whole surface of the earth could produce in several
years, and which in value would exceed all the riches, perhaps,
on the globe.</p>


<p class="p6">THE KNOWING SHEPHERD.</p>

<p>A shepherd was going to market with some sheep, when
he met a man who said to him, "Good morning, friend, with
your score." "No," said the shepherd, "I have not a score;
but if I had as many more, half as many more, and two
sheep and a half, I should have just a score." How many
sheep had he?</p>

<p>He had 7 sheep: as many more 7; half as many more,
3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>; and 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>; making in all 20.</p>


<p class="p6">THE CERTAIN GAME.</p>

<p>Two persons agree to take, alternately, numbers less than
a given number, for example, 11, and to add them together
till one of them has reached a certain sum, such as 100. By
what means can one of them infallibly attain to that number
before the other?</p>

<p>The whole artifice in this consists in immediately making
choice of the numbers 1, 12, 23, 34, and so on, or of a series
which continually increases by 11, up to 100. Let us suppose
that the first person, who knows the game, makes choice
of 1; it is evident that his adversary, as he must count less
than 11, can at most reach 11, by adding 10 to it. The first
will then take 1, which will make 12; and whatever number
the second may add the first will certainly win, provided he
continually add the number which forms the complement of
that of his adversary to 11; that is to say, if the latter take
8, he must take 3; if 9, he must take 2; and so on. By following
this method he will infallibly attain to 89, and it will
then be impossible for the second to prevent him from getting
first to 100; for whatever number the second takes he
can attain only to 99; after which the first may say&mdash;"and 1
makes 100." If the second take 1 after 89, it would make
90, and his adversary would finish by saying&mdash;"and 10 make
100." Between two persons who are equally acquainted
with the game, he who begins must necessarily win.</p>

A afterwards took 60 alone, which he sold <em>as before</em>, at 5 for

<p>This is rather a catch question, the insinuation that the first
lot were sold at the rate of five for $2, being only true in part.
They commence selling at that rate, but after making ten
sales, A's pigs are exhausted, and they have received $20:
B still has 10 which he sells at "2 for a dollar" and of course
receives $5; whereas had he sold them at the rate of 5 for
$2, he would have received but $4. Hence the difficulty is
easily settled.</p>

<p>Now, if another person and yourself have fifty counters
a-piece, and agree never to stake more than ten at a time,
you may tell him that if he permit you to stake first, you
always complete the even century before him.</p>

<p>In order to succeed, you must first stake 1, and remembering
the order of the above series, constantly add to what he
stakes as many as will make one more than the numbers 11,
22, 33, &amp;c., of which it is composed, till you come to 89, after
which your opponent cannot possibly reach the even century
himself, or prevent you from reaching it.</p>

<p>If your opponent has no knowledge of numbers, you may
stake any other number first, under 10, provided you subsequently
take care to secure one of the last terms, 56, 67, 78,
&amp;c.; or you may even let him stake first, if you take care
afterward to secure one of these numbers.</p>

<p>This exercise may be performed with other numbers; but,
in order to succeed, you must divide the number to be attained
by a number which is a unit greater than what you
can stake each time, and the remainder will then be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
number you must first stake. Suppose, for example, the
number to be attained be 52 (making use of a pack of cards
instead of counters), and that you are never to add more
than 6; then, dividing 52 by 7, the remainder, which is 3,
will be the number which you must first stake; and whatever
your opponent stakes, you must add as much to it as
will make it equal to 7, the number by which you divided,
and so in continuation.</p>


<p class="p6">THE UNLUCKY HATTER.</p>

<p>A blackleg passing through a town in Ohio, bought a hat
for $8 and gave in payment a $50 bill. The hatter called on
a merchant near by, who changed the note for him, and the
blackleg having received his $42 change went his way.
The next day the merchant discovered the note to be a counterfeit,
and called upon the hatter, who was compelled forthwith
to borrow $50 of another friend to redeem it with; but
on turning to search for the blackleg he had left town, so
that the note was useless on the hatter's hands. The question
is, what did he lose&mdash;was it $50 besides the hat, or was
it $50 including the hat?</p>

<p>This question is generally given with names and circumstances
as a real transaction, and if the company knows such
persons so much the better, as it serves to withdraw attention
from the question; and in almost every case the first
impression is, that the hatter lost $50 besides the hat, though
it is evident he was paid for the hat, and had he kept the $8
he needed only to have borrowed $42 additional to redeem
the note.</p>


<p class="p6">THE BASKET OF NUTS.</p>

<p>A person remarked that when he counted over his basket
of nuts, two by two, three by three, four by four, five by
five, or six by six, there was one remaining; but when he
counted them by sevens, there was no remainder. How
many had he?</p>

<p>The least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 being 60,
it is evident, that if 61 were divisible by 7, it would answer
the conditions of the question. This not being the case,
however, let 60 × 2 + 1, 60 × 3 + 1, 60 × 4 + 1, &amp;c., be tried
successively, and it will be found that 301 = 60 × 5 + 1, is
divisible by 7; and consequently this number answers the
conditions of the question. If to this we add 420, the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, the sum 721 will be
another answer; and by adding perpetually 420, we may
find as many answers as we please.</p>

<p class="p6">THE TWO DROVERS.</p>

<p>Two drovers, A and B, meeting on the road, began discoursing
about the number of sheep they each had. Says
B to A, "Pray give me one of your sheep and I will have
as many as you." "Nay," replied A, "but give me one of
your sheep and I will have as many again as you." Required
to know the number of sheep they each had?</p>

<p>A had seven and B had five sheep.</p>


<p class="p6">THE BASKET AND STONES.</p>

<p>If a hundred stones be placed in a straight line, at the
distance of a yard from each other, the first being at the
same distance from a basket, how many yards must the
person walk who engages to pick them up, one by one, and
put them into the basket? It is evident that, to pick up
the first stone, and put it into the basket, the person must
walk two yards; for the second, he must walk four; for
the third, six: and so on increasing by two, to the hundredth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The number of yards, therefore, which the person must
walk will be equal to the sum of the progression, 2, 4, 6,
&amp;c., the last term of which is 200 (22). But the sum of the
progression is equal to 202, the sum of the two extremes,
multiplied by 50, or half the number of terms: that is to say,
10,100 yards, which makes more than 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> miles.</p>

<p class="p6">THE EXPUNGED FIGURE.</p>

<p>In the first place desire a person to write down secretly,
in a line, any number of figures he may choose, and add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
them together as units; having done this, tell him to subtract
that sum from the line of figures originally set down;
then desire him to strike out any figure he pleases, and
add the remaining figures in the line together as units, (as
in the first instance,) and inform you of the result, when
you will tell him the figure he has struck out.</p>

<p>76542-24<br />
<span class="mleft1">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>24<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
76518<br />
</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, the figures put down
are 76542; these, added together, as units, make
a total of 24: deduct 24 from the first line, and
76518 remain; if 5, the center figure be struck
out, the total will be 22. If 8, the first figure
be struck out, 19 will be the total.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain which figure has been struck out,
you make a mental sum one multiple of 9 higher than the
total given. If 22 be given as the total, then 3 times 9 are
27, and 22 from 27 show that 5 was struck out. If 19 be
given, that sum deducted from 27 shows 8.</p>

<p>Should the total be equal multiplies of 9, as 18, 27, 36,
then 9 has been expunged.</p>

<p>With very little practice any person may perform this
with rapidity, it is therefore needless to give any further
examples. The only way in which a person can fail in
solving this riddle is, when either the number 9 or a cipher
is struck out, as it then becomes impossible to tell which
of the two it is, the sum of the figure in the line being an
even number of nines in both cases.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MYSTERIOUS ADDITION.</p>

<p>It is required to name the quotient of five or three lines
of figures&mdash;each line consisting of five or more figures&mdash;only
seeing the first line before the other lines are even put
down. Any person may write down the first line of figures
for you. How do you find the quotient?</p>

<p>E<span class="smcapa">XAMPLE</span>.&mdash;When the first line of figures is set down, subtract
2 from the last right-hand figure, and place it before
the first figure of the line, and that is the quotient for five
lines. For example, suppose the figures given are 86,214,
the quotient will be 286,212. You may allow any person
to put down the two first and the fourth lines, but you must
always set down the third and fifth lines, and in doing so,
always make up 9 with the line above, as in the following
example:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore in the annexed diagram you will see
that you have made 9 in the third and fifth lines
with the lines above them. If the person desire
to put down the figures should set down a 1 or
0 for the last figure, you must say we will have
another figure, and another, and so on until he
sets down something above 1 or 2.</p>

<p><span class="mleft1a">&nbsp;</span>86,214<br />
<span class="mleft1a">&nbsp;</span>42,680<br />
<span class="mleft1a">&nbsp;</span>57,319<br />

<span class="mleft1a">&nbsp;</span>37,145<br />
<span class="mleft1a">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Qt. 268,212</p>

<p>In solving the puzzle with three lines, you
subtract 1 from the last figure, and place it
before the first figure, and make up the third
line yourself to 9. For example: 67,856 is
given, and the quotient will be 167,855, as
shown in the above diagram.</p>

<p><span class="mleft1b">&nbsp;</span>67,856<br />
<span class="mleft1b">&nbsp;</span>47,218<br />

<p class="p6">TO TELL AT WHAT HOUR A PERSON INTENDS TO RISE.</p>

<p>Let the person set the hand of the dial of a watch at any
hour he pleases, and tell you what hour that is; and to the
number of that hour you add in your mind 12; then tell him
to count privately the number of that amount upon the dial,
beginning with the next hour to that on which he proposes
to rise, and counting backwards, first reckoning the number
of the hour at which he has placed the hand. For example:</p>

<p>Suppose the hour at which he intends to rise be 8, and
that he has placed the hand at 5; you will add 12 to 5, and
tell him to count 17 on the dial, first reckoning 5, the hour
at which the index stands, and counting backwards from
the hour at which he intends to rise; and the number 17
will necessarily end at 8, which shows that to be the hour
he chose.</p>


<p class="p6">TO FIND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO NUMBERS, THE GREATEST
OF WHICH IS UNKNOWN.</p>

<p>Take as many nines as there are figures in the smallest
number, and subtract that sum from the number of nines.
Let another person add the difference to the largest number,
and talking away the first figure of the amount add it to the
last figure, and that sum will be the difference of the two
numbers.</p>

<p>For example: John, who is 22, tells Thomas, who is older,
that he can discover the difference of their ages; he therefore
privately deducts 22 from 99 (his age consisting of
two figures, he of course takes two nines); the difference,
which is 77, he tells Thomas to add to his age, and to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
away the first figure from the amount, and add it to the last
figure and that will be the difference of their ages; thus,</p>

<p>The difference between John's age and 99 is <span class="mleft1">&nbsp;</span>77<br />
To which Thomas adding his age <span class="mleft5">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>35<br />
<span class="mleft18">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="mleft6">&nbsp;</span>The sum is <span class="mleft7">&nbsp;</span> 112<br />
Then by taking away the first figure 1, and<br />
&nbsp; adding it to the figure 2, the sum is <span class="mleft4">&nbsp;</span>13<br />
Which add to John's age <span class="mleft8a">&nbsp;</span>22<br />
<span class="mleft18">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Gives the age of Thomas <span class="mleft8b">&nbsp;</span>35</p>


<p class="p6">THE REMAINDER.</p>

<p>A very pleasing way to arrive at an arithmetical sum,
without the use of either slate or pencil, is to ask a person
to think of a figure, then to double it, then add a certain
figure to it, now halve the whole sum, and finally to subtract
from that the figure first thought of. You are then to
tell the thinker what is the remainder.</p>

<p>The key to this lock of figures is, that <span class="smcapa">HALF</span> of whatever
sum you request to be added during the working of the sum
is <span class="smcapa">THE REMAINDER</span>. In the example given, five is the half of
ten, the number requested to be added. Any amount may
be added, but the operation is simplified by giving only even
numbers, as they will divide without fractions.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Example.</em></p>

<p>Think of <span class="mleft11a">&nbsp;</span>7<br />
Double it <span class="mleft10b">&nbsp;</span>14<br />
Add 10 to it <span class="mleft9b">&nbsp;</span>10<br />
<span class="mleft14">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Halve it <span class="mleft10a">&nbsp;</span>2)24<br />
<span class="mleft14">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Which will leave <span class="mleft7a">&nbsp;</span>12<br />
Subtract the number thought of <span class="mleft2">&nbsp;</span>7<br />
<span class="mleft14">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash;<br />
T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> R<span class="smcapa">EMAINDER</span> will be <span class="mleft5b">&nbsp;</span>5</p>


<p class="p6">A PERSON HAVING AN EQUAL NUMBER OF COUNTERS, OR PIECES OF
MONEY, IN EACH HAND, TO FIND HOW MANY HE HAS ALTOGETHER.</p>

<p>Request the person to convey any number, as 4, for example,
from the one hand to the other, and then ask how many
times the less number is contained in the greater. Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
suppose that he says the one is the triple of the other; and,
in this case, multiply 4, the number of the counters conveyed,
by 3, and add to the product the same number, which
will make 16. Lastly, take 1 from 3, and if 16 be divided by
the remainder 2, the quotient will be the number contained
in each hand, and consequently the whole number is 16.</p>

<p>This curious problem deserves another example. Let us
again suppose that 4 counters are passed from one hand to
the other, and the less number is contained in the greater
2 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>3</sub></span> times. In this case, we must, as before, multiply 4 by
2 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>3</sub></span>, which will give 9 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>3</sub></span>; to which, if 4 be added, we shall
have 13 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>3</sub></span>, or <span class="frac"><sup>40</sup><span>/</span><sub>3</sub></span>; if 1, then, be taken from 2 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>3</sub></span>, the remainder
will be 1 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>3</sub></span>, or <span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>/</span><sub>3</sub></span>, by which, if <span class="frac"><sup>40</sup><span>/</span><sub>3</sub></span> be divided, the quotient 10
will be the number of counters in each hand.</p>


<p class="p6">THE THREE JEALOUS HUSBANDS.</p>

<p>Three jealous husbands, A, B, and C, with their wives, being
ready to pass by night over a river, find at the water
side a boat which can carry but two at a time, and for want
of a waterman they are compelled to row themselves over
the river at several times. The question is how those six
persons shall pass, two at a time, so that none of the three
wives may be found in the company of one or two men, unless
her husband be present?</p>

<p>This may be effected in two or three ways; the following
may be as good as any: Let A and wife go over&mdash;let A return&mdash;let
B's and C's wives go over&mdash;A's wife returns&mdash;B and
C go over&mdash;B and wife return, A and B go over&mdash;C's wife
returns, and A's and B's wives go over&mdash;then C comes back
for his wife. Simple as this question may appear, it is found
in the works of Alcuin, who flourished a thousand years ago,
hundreds of years before the art of printing was invented.</p>


<p class="p6">THE FALSE SCALES.</p>

<p>A cheese being put into one of the scales of a false balance,
was found to weigh 16 lbs., and when put into the
other only 9 lbs. What is the true weight?</p>

<p>The true weight is a mean proportional between the two
false ones, and is found by extracting the square root of
their product. Thus 16 × 9 = 144; and square root 144 = 12
lbs., the weight required.</p>

<p>A poor woman, carrying a basket of apples, was met by
three boys, the first of whom bought half of what she had,

of what remained, and gave her back 2; and the third
bought half of what she had now left, and returned her 1;
after which she found she had 12 apples remaining. What
number had she at first?</p>

<p>From the 12 remaining, deduct 1, and 11 is the number
she sold the last boy, which was half she had; her number
at that time, therefore, was 22. From 22 deduct two, and
the remaining 20 was 2/3 of her prior stock, which was therefore
30. From 30 deduct 10, and the remainder 20 is half

<p>The three Graces, carrying each an equal number of
oranges, were met by the nine Muses, who asked for some
of them; and each Grace having given to each Muse the
same number, it was then found that they had all equal
shares. How many had the Graces at first?</p>

<p>The least number that will answer this question is twelve;
for if we suppose that each Grace gave one to each Muse,
the latter would each have three, and there would remain
three for each Grace. (Any multiple of 12 will answer the
conditions of the question.)</p>

<p>A countryman having a Fox, a Goose, and a peck of Corn,
came to a river, where it so happened that he could carry
but one over at a time. Now as no two were to be left together
that might destroy each other, he was at his wit's
end, for says he "Though the corn can't eat the goose, nor
the goose eat the fox; yet the fox can eat the goose, and
the goose eat the corn." How shall he carry them over, that
they shall not destroy each other?</p>

<p>Let him first take over the Goose, leaving the Fox and
Corn; then let him take over the Fox and bring the Goose
back; then take over the Corn; and lastly take over the
Goose again.</p>


<p class="p6">MULTIPLYING MONEY BY MONEY.</p>

<p>Amongst the various questions that are given for the purpose
of puzzling the unwary arithmetician, the multiplication
of money by money is one of the most curious: take for instance
the following problems:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Multiply £99 19<em>s.</em> 11<span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>/</span><sub>4</sub></span><em>d.</em> by £99 19<em>s.</em> 11<span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>/</span><sub>4</sub></span><em>d.</em><br />
Multiply £11 11<em>s.</em> 11<em>d.</em> by £11 11<em>s.</em> 11<em>d.</em></p>

<p>To the uninitiated they usually appear easy of solution
but the various modes of working them out, and the different
results obtained, prove that there is something absurd and
wrong in the questions themselves. Some reduce all to
farthings, and after multiplying one term by the other, return
the product into pounds, shillings, and pence. Others
convert them into decimals; whilst some work the problem
in the style of duodecimals.</p>

<p>Having sufficiently puzzled the tyros, the querist remarks:
"The problem itself is absurd, it is incapable of solution;
for what is the nature of the product of pounds, shillings,
and pence multiplied by pounds, shillings and pence? We
know that a yard multiplied by a yard is a square yard, but
who can tell what is a penny multiplied by a penny, or a
penny by a pound?"</p>

<p>Now all this is quite correct, provided the question is
limited, as above to the product of pounds, shillings, and
pence, into pounds, shillings, and pence; <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'put'">but</ins> suppose the
problem were put in this form&mdash;If a capital of £1 produces
by compound interest, in a certain time, £99 19<em>s.</em> 11<span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>/</span><sub>4</sub></span><em>d.</em>, how
much would be produced by a capital of £99 19<em>s.</em> 11<span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>/</span><sub>4</sub></span><em>d.?</em> It
is evident that, to answer this, we must multiply £99 19<em>s.</em>
11<span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>/</span><sub>4</sub></span><em>d.</em> by £99 19<em>s.</em> 11<span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>/</span><sub>4</sub></span><em>d.</em>: these are in fact the second and,
third terms of an ordinary "rule of three;" and though one
of the terms is a "concrete" quantity of pounds, shillings,
and pence, the other must be regarded as an "abstract"
mathematical quantity, being 99 and a fraction, of which
the number of farthings in a pound is the denominator 960,
and the number of farthings in the third term is the numerator,
959; or, instead of this, the shillings and pence might be
converted into decimals of a pound, or into aliquot parts.
The product of multiplying £99 19<em>s.</em> 11<span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>/</span><sub>4</sub></span><em>d.</em> by 99<span class="frac"><sup>959</sup><span>/</span><sub>960</sub></span> is £9,999
15<em>s.</em> 10<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>3840</sub></span><em>d.</em>; the quickest way of doing this, is to multiply
by 100, and to subtract from the product the 960th part of
the multiplicand.</p>

<p>In the other question proposed, the product of £11 11<em>s.</em>
11<em>d.</em> into £11 11<em>s.</em> 11<em>d.</em>, or 11 <span class="frac"><sup>143</sup><span>/</span><sub>240</sub></span>, is £134 9<em>s.</em> 3<span class="frac"><sup>493</sup><span>/</span><sub>240</sub></span><em>d.</em></p>

<p>Number and value are distinct abstract ideas, and cannot,
without committing a logical absurdity, be confused. To
multiply is to repeat a certain number of <em>times</em>, and it is obviously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
impossible to bring <em>value</em> into the question. Value
is arbitrary; number is fixed. Put it in this way, and the
absurdity is evident: One pound is equivalent to 20 shillings,
or 240 pence, or 960 farthings. In value there is no
difference whatever; but what an enormous difference between
multiplying by 1, 20, 240, or 960!</p>


<p class="p6">THE UNFAIR DIVISION.</p>

<p>A gentleman rented a farm, and contracted to give to his
landlord <span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>/</span><sub>5</sub></span> of the produce; <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'put'">but</ins> prior to the time of dividing
the corn, the tenant used 45 bushels. When the general
division was made, it was proposed to give to the landlord
18 bushels from the heap, in lieu of his share of the 45
bushels which the tenant had used, and then to begin and
divide the remainder as though none had been used. Would
this method have been correct?</p>

<p>The landlord would lose 7<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>/</span><sub>5</sub></span> bushels by such an arrangement,
as the rent would entitle him to <span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>/</span><sub>5</sub></span> of the 18. The
tenant should give him 18 bushels from his own share after
the division is completed, otherwise the landlord would receive
but <span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>/</span><sub>7</sub></span> of the first 63 bushels.</p>


<p class="p6">A POPULAR FALLACY.</p>

<p>It is often suggested from the pulpit and elsewhere, that
enough persons have lived and died in the world to cover
its whole surface with bodies; and even two or three strata
deep. Is this probable?</p>

<p>Say the earth has existed 6000 years, the population always
having been 800,000,000, and the average life of man 30
years; this being the utmost that could be claimed. Allow
then the State of Virginia to contain 70,000 square miles,
and each grave to occupy a space of 6 feet by 2; the
territory of the State would contain 162,624,000,000; while
the mighty army of the dead would number only 160,000,000,000;
leaving 2,624,000,000 graves yet unoccupied.
How wide of truth then is the position often set forth so
positively!</p>

  <div class="i0">"Let young beginners come and try</div>
  <div class="i0">Their hands at our geometry."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The word Geometry is derived from the Greek, and signifies
the art of measuring land. The invention of it is
ascribed by some to the Chaldeans and Babylonians, by
others to the Egyptians, who were obliged to determine the
boundaries of their fields after the inundation of the Nile,
by geometrical measurements. According to Cassiodorus,
the Egyptians either derived the art from the Babylonians,
or invented it after it was known to them. Thales, a Phœnician,
who died 548 years <span class="smcapa">B.C.</span>, and Pythagoras of Samos,
who flourished about 520 <span class="smcapa">B.C.</span>, introduced it from Egypt into
Greece. In elementary geometry, Euclid of Alexandria, as
everybody knows, is particularly distinguished. Archimedes
measured the sphere, and after him other philosophers
prosecuted the science with the utmost assiduity. In Italy,
where the sciences first revived after the dark ages, several
mathematicians were distinguished in the 16th century.
The French, and after them the Germans, followed; while
in England, Hook, Newton, and others, carried the science
to the highest pitch of usefulness, and through its aid made
the most prodigious discoveries. It is not, however, our
province to enter into a long disquisition on the subject, but
simply to set before the young reader some of the more
curious properties of the science, that he may be excited
to study it for himself; and we will promise him that
should he devote his mind to its study, he will be amply
repaid for any amount of labor he may bestow upon it.</p>


<p class="p6">GEOMETRICAL DEFINITIONS.</p>

<p>In geometry a <em>point</em> is said to have neither breadth, length,
nor thickness. A <em>line</em> is the distance between two points;
parallel lines always keep at the same distance from each
other. A <em>right</em> line is what is commonly called a straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
line. A <em>curve</em> is a line which continually changes its direction.
An <em>angle</em> is the inclination or opening of two lines
meeting in a point. A <em>figure</em> is a bounded space, and is
either a superficies or a solid. A <em>triangle</em> is a figure with
three sides and three angles. A <em>square</em> has four equal sides,
and four right angles. A <em>circle</em> is a plane figure bounded
by a curved line running into itself. Its diameter is a
straight line drawn from one extremity of its circumference
to the other, and its center is equally distant from every
part of the circumference. A <em>solid</em> is any body which has
length, breadth, and thickness; and a sphere is a solid,
terminated by a convex surface, every part of which is at
an equal distance from a point within, called its center.</p>

<p>The following figures will show how the five geometrical
solids may be cut out of a piece of cardboard. Where
the lines are drawn the board is to be partly cut through
with a penknife, so as to render the angles of the models as
sharp and as straight as possible. The edges which require
joining are to be fastened together with a slip of thin paper
and gum dissolved in just sufficient water to bring it to the
consistence of treacle. Fig. 1 will form a tetrahedron, a
figure with four sides, each shaped like an equilateral triangle.
Fig. 2 forms a cube or hexahedron. Fig. 3 an octohedron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>

<p>The following sleight shows how easily the eye may be
deceived. Take a piece of pasteboard, an inch and a half
in width, and five inches in length, and divide it by inked
lines into thirty squares, then cut it from corner to corner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
so as to form two triangles. After this cut off the top of
these triangles at <span class="smcapa">C</span> and <span class="smcapa">D</span>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and arrange the pieces in this

<p>On counting the squares in the first figure, there appear
to be thirty, but the other arrangement of the same card
seems to contain thirty-two. It does so, however, only in
appearance, but it is only a very correct eye that can detect
the imperfection.</p>


<p class="p6">THE CARPENTER PUZZLED.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 155px;">
<img src="images/i_259b.jpg" width="155" height="226" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A carpenter having a piece of mahogany of a triangular
form, (see Fig.) wished to know how he could make it up
to the best advantage. His first idea was to make an oblong
square table of it, but he found that if he did so the
waste of the wood would be very great.
After consideration he discovered that
the most economical method of using
the wood would be to form it into an
oval. To make this oval contain as
much wood as possible, he proceeded in
the following manner: Let <span class="smcapa">B G D</span> be
the triangular piece of wood; take <span class="smcapa">G H</span>
one half of the base, and divide the
triangle by drawing a line from <span class="smcapa">H</span> to <span class="smcapa">B</span>.
Take <span class="smcapa">G H</span> in the compasses, and set it
off on one of the sides from <span class="smcapa">G</span> to <span class="smcapa">E</span>, draw
the line <span class="smcapa">E F</span>, and the point <span class="smcapa">I</span> will be the center of the oval;
draw <span class="smcapa">K L</span> parallel to <span class="smcapa">E F</span>, and at the same distance from the
center as the base <span class="smcapa">G</span>. The points <span class="smcapa">A</span> and <span class="smcapa">C</span> are found by
dividing the line from <span class="smcapa">E</span> to <span class="smcapa">K</span> and drawing <span class="smcapa">A C</span>, or by drawing
the dotted lines <span class="smcapa">D A</span> and <span class="smcapa">G C</span> through the center at <span class="smcapa">I</span>.
These points being found, the oval must be completed by
the eye of the draughtsman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p class="p6">THE BRICKLAYER PUZZLED.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/i_260a.jpg" width="315" height="105" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A bricklayer had to construct a wall, whose length in the
direction <span class="smcapa">A B C</span> was twenty-four feet. The one half of this
wall, namely from <span class="smcapa">B</span> to <span class="smcapa">C</span>, had to be built over a piece of
rising ground, so that the base of this part of the wall
would necessarily be more than twelve feet. In making
out his account he charged more for this half of the wall
than for that which was built on level ground from <span class="smcapa">A</span> to <span class="smcapa">B</span>.
A geometrician assured him that the square contents of
both portions of the wall were exactly alike; which may
be proved in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_260b.jpg" width="412" height="84" alt="" />
</div>

<img src="images/i_260c.jpg" width="175" height="93" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><em>Fig. 4.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Cut two pieces of cardboard, in the form shown in Figs.
2 and 3, to represent the two parts of the wall; lay
the piece representing the straight wall on the curved piece,
and it will be found that the angles
which project at <span class="smcapa">A</span> and <span class="smcapa">B</span> will exactly
fill up the spaces at <span class="smcapa">E</span> and <span class="smcapa">F</span>. The piece
of board representing the straight
wall may thus be found to be exactly
sufficient to form a piece equal to that
representing the curved wall. You may then lay the curved
piece upon the straight one, and reversing the experiment
prove that the curved piece is capable of forming a rectangular
piece equal to the other.</p>


<p class="p6">TRIANGULAR PROBLEM.</p>

<p>Take four square pieces of pasteboard of the same dimensions,
and divide them diagonally, that is, by drawing a line
from two opposite angles, as in the figures, into eight triangles.
Paint seven of these triangles with the prismatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
colors, red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, violet, and let the
eighth be white. To find how
many chequers or regular four-sided
figures, different either in
form or color, may be made out
of these eight triangles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_261a.jpg" width="227" height="189" alt="" />
</div>

<p>First, by combining two of these
triangles there may be formed,
either the triangular square <span class="smcapa">A</span>, or
the inclined square <span class="smcapa">B</span>, called a Rhomb. Secondly, by combining
four of the triangles the large square <span class="smcapa">C</span> may be
formed, or the long square <span class="smcapa">D</span>, called a parallelogram. Now
the first two squares, consisting of two parts out of eight,
may each of them by the eighth rank of the triangle be
taken twenty-eight different ways, which makes fifty-six.
And the last two squares, consisting of four parts, may each
be taken by the same rank of the triangle seventy times,
which makes 140.</p>


<p class="p6">TO FORM A SQUARE.</p>

<p>Take a piece of card of the shape and size or proportions
of the subjoined, and cut it into three
parts, and with these three form a perfect
square.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/i_261b.jpg" width="165" height="113" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To do this, cut it in the direction of
the dotted lines, and it will then be easy
to lay down the pieces to form a perfect
square.</p>


<p class="p6">SQUARING THE CIRCLE.</p>

<p>"Squaring the circle," as it is called, is the puzzle of
puzzles, and there are many persons who fancy this can be
accomplished, as there are also many who believe that they
can discover "perpetual motion."</p>

<p>The meaning of this phrase <em>squaring</em> is scientifically expressed
by the term finding the quadrature of the circle;
that is, the act of producing a square equal to a given circle;
and many persons but slightly acquainted with mathematics
have puzzled their brains to effect this object. The
Cardinal de Cusa rolled a cylinder over a plane, till the
point which was first in contact with the plane touched it
again; and then, by a train of reasoning very unmathematical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
he endeavored to determine the length of the line thus
described. Oliver de Serras worked a circle, and also a
triangle equal to an equilateral triangle, inscribed within
the circle, and imagined that the former was exactly equal
to two of the latter, forgetting that the double of this triangle
is equal to the hexagon inscribed within the circle,
and therefore smaller than the circle itself. A Frenchman
challenged the world, and deposited 10,000 livres as a stake,
that he could accomplish the feat. He reduced the problem
to the mechanical process of dividing a circle into four
quarters, and then turning these with their angles outwards,
so as to form a square, which he asserted to be equal to
the circle; this however was soon proved to be ridiculous.</p>

<p>Some persons have taken a piece of pasteboard, and cutting
it out into a circular form, and by cutting that circular disc
into pieces of a square form and definite dimensions, and fitting
the same turned pieces one into the other, have come <em>near</em>
to a notion of the superficial area of a circle. But this kind
of demonstration is purely mechanical, and is neither geometrical
nor scientific, and, is in fact, no demonstration according
to mathematics. For if we take the pieces of card,
however exactly they may appear to be formed, and examine
them with a microscope, we shall soon find that none of them
are geometrically true, nor of the same length or breadth,
and therefore the conclusion arrived at is a false one.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_262.jpg" width="500" height="107" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The early mathematicians, in their attempts to solve this
problem, generally proceeded on the following plan. If we
draw a square exterior to a circle, that is, touching the
square in four points, each side of the square being equal to
the diameter of the circle, we can soon convince ourselves
that the boundary of the square will be greater than the
circumference of the circle, and the area of the former
greater than that of the latter. But if the square be drawn
within the circle, so that only the four corners touch it, then
it is equally evident that the circle is larger, both in boundary
and area, than the square. By this proceeding, we
arrive at the conclusion that a circle is <em>smaller</em> than a square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<em>external</em> to it, and <em>larger</em> than one <em>internal</em> to it. Let us next
suppose that we draw a regular pentagon, that is, a figure
of five equal sides, exterior to the circle, and touching it on
five points; then it is evident that as the circle is wholly
contained within the pentagon, it must be smaller than that
which contains it. But if the pentagon be described within
the circle, touching it at the five angular points, then of
course the circle is larger than the pentagon which it contains.</p>

<p>Now, in geometry, my young readers must bear in mind,
the exact periphery or circumference, and the exact area of
any figure bounded by straight lines, may be determined
with rigorous accuracy; and if we draw two polygons&mdash;say
of one hundred sides, one within and one without the circle&mdash;we
can ascertain the exact area of those polygons, and
affirm that the area of a circle is greater than a certain
amount, and less than another certain amount. These two
amounts, if the number of the sides of the polygon be so
large as we here suppose, may be so very nearly alike, that
either one will give the area of the circle with great closeness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_263.jpg" width="400" height="199" alt="" />
</div>

<p>By some such means as these Archimedes found that
if the diameter of a circle be called 7, then the circumference
will be nearly 22; and that if the square of the
diameter be 14, then the area of the circle will be equal
to about 11; but this computation was slightly in error, and
gave to the area of the circle too great a measure by about
one three-thousandth part of the whole. At a later period,
however, a European mathematician, named Metius, discovered
a method which makes an extraordinary approach to
accuracy, and is at the same time easily remembered. He
found that if the diameter be considered equal to 113, then
the circumference would equal 355; or if we multiply the
square of the radius by 355, and divide it by 113, the area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
will be given. Now this method is so very nearly correct,
that the area of a circle one foot in diameter is given within
the fifty-thousandth part of a square inch.</p>

<p>Other mathematicians have carried the approximation still
further. Ludolph Van Ceulen worked it out to 36 places of
figures, showing that if the diameter be 1, the circumference
will be</p>

<blockquote><p>3.14,159,265,358,979,323,846,264,338,327,950,288.</p></blockquote>

<p>or that if the last figure be 8, the result will be a little below
the truth, and if 9, a little above it.</p>

<p>Since this, Mr. Sharp, an English mathematician, carried
the approximation to 72 places of figures; Mr. John Machin
to 100 figures, and eclipsed all others. M. de Lagny worked
it out to 128 places of figures, and of the degree of <em>nearness</em>
to which this computation brings the proportion, Montucla
says, "If we suppose a circle, the <em>diameter</em> of which is a
thousand million times greater than the distance between
the sun and the earth, the error in the proportion of the circumference
would be a thousand million times less than the
thickness of a hair."</p>

<p>But after all, none of these computations are quite correct;
they all deviate from the truth, and bring us to the conclusion
that there are no numbers or collection of numbers
which will give the exact ratio of the circumference, or of
the area of a circle to its diameter. We offer this explanation
on the subject to our young friends that they may not
be puzzled by the question; and that should they be asked
to square the circle, or hear any one assert that he can do
so, they may be able to show that they are "awake" to the
question, and know how to explain it.</p>

<p>Paradoxes and Puzzles, although by many persons looked
upon as mere trifles, have, in numerous instances, cost their
inventors considerable time, and exhibit a great degree of
ingenuity. We can readily imagine that some of the complicated
puzzles in the ensuing pages may have been originally
constructed by captives, to pass away the hours of a
long and dreary imprisonment; thus does the misery of a
few frequently conduce to the amusement of many. We
look upon a Paradox as a sort of superior riddle, and a tolerable
Puzzle, in our opinion, takes precedence of a first-rate
rebus. There is often considerable thought, calculation,
patience, and management, required to solve some of these
strange enigmas; and we have, ere now, followed the
mazes of a Puzzle so ardently, as to be entirely absorbed
in devising means to extricate ourself from its bewildering
difficulties; and felt almost as much pleasure in eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
achieving victory over it, as we have in conquering an adversary
at some superior game of skill. It is "in good
sooth, a right dainty and pleasant pastime," to watch the
stray wanderings of another person attempting to elucidate
a Paradox, or perform a Puzzle, with which one is previously
acquainted. It is laughable to see him elated with hope
at the apparent speedy end of his troubles, when you know
that, at that moment, he is actually farther from his object
than he was when he began; and it is no less amusing to
watch his increasing despair, as he conceives himself to be
getting more and more involved, when you are well aware
that he is within a single turn of a happy termination of his
toils; but what a mirthful moment is that, when there being
only two ways to turn, the one right and the other wrong,
as is usually the case, he takes the latter, and becomes
more than ever</p>

<p class="center">"Pozed, puzzled, and perplexed."</p>

<p>Puzzles are by no means of modern origin; the Sphynx
puzzled the brains of some of the heroes of antiquity, and
even Alexander the Great, as it is written, made several
essays to untie the knot with which Gordius, the Phrygian
king, who had been raised from the plow to the throne, tied
up his implements of husbandry in the temple, in so intricate
a manner, that universal monarchy was promised to
the man who could undo it: after having been repeatedly
baffled, he, at length, drew his sword, considering that he
was entitled to the fulfillment of the promise, by cutting the
Gordian knot.</p>

<p>Provide a thin piece of wood of about two inches and a

large to admit three or four times the thickness of the cord
you will afterwards use, and in the middle of
the board make four smaller round holes in the
form of a square, and about half an inch between
each. Then take four pieces of thin silken
cord, each about six inches long, pass one
through each of the four corner holes, tying a
knot underneath at the end, or affixing a little
ball or bead to prevent its drawing through;
take another cord, which, when doubled, will
be about seven inches long, and pass the two ends through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the middle holes <em>a a</em>, from the front to the back of the board,
(one cord through each hole,) and again from back to front
through the other holes <em>b b</em>; tie the six ends together in a
knot, so as to form a small scale, and proportioning the
length of the cords, so that when you hold the scale suspended,
the middle cord, besides passing through the four
center holes, will admit of being drawn up into a loop of
about half an inch from the surface of the scale; provide a
ring of metal or bone, of about three quarters of an inch in
diameter, and place it on the scale, bringing the loop through
its middle; then, drawing the loop a little through the
scale toward you, pass it, double as it is, through the hole
at the corner A, over the knot underneath, and draw it back;
then pass it in the same way through the hole at corner B,
over the knot, and draw it back; then, drawing up the
loop a little more, pass it over the knot at top, and afterward
through the holes C and D in succession, like the
others, and the ring will be fixed.</p>

string, with a smaller heart attached at the end, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
No. 1, pass it behind, and bring it through 2 before, and
through 3, and so on to 6, when a loop must be made so as
to enclose that part of the string which runs from 2 to 3.
The puzzle is to remove the string from the large heart altogether,
without unfastening the loop.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to avoid twisting or entangling the
string. The length of the string should be proportioned to
the size of the heart; if you make the heart two inches
and a half high, the string when doubled should be about
nine inches long.</p>

<p class="p6">19. THE CARD PUZZLE.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_272c.jpg" width="141" height="159" alt="" />
</div>

<p>One of the best puzzles hitherto made is represented in
the annexed cut. A is a piece of card; <em>b b</em> a narrow slip
divided from its bottom edge, the whole breadth of the
card, except just sufficient to hold it on at
each side; <em>c c</em> is another small slip of card
with two large square ends, <em>e e</em>; <em>d</em> is a bit of
tobacco-pipe, through which <em>c c</em> is passed, and
which is kept on by the two ends <em>e e</em>. The
puzzle consists in getting the pipe off without
breaking it or injuring any other part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
puzzle. This, which appears to be impossible, is done in the
most simple manner. On a moment's consideration it will
appear plainly that there must be as much difficulty in getting
the pipe in its present situation, as there can be in
taking it away. The way to put the puzzle together is as
follows: The slip <em>c c e e</em> is cut out of a piece of card in the
shape delineated in Fig. 3. The card in the first figure
must then be gently bent at A, so as to allow of the slip at
the bottom of it being also bent sufficiently to pass double
through the pipe, as in Fig. 2. The detached slip with the
square ends (Fig. 3) is then to be passed half way through
the loop <em>f</em> at the bottom of the pipe; it is next to be
doubled in the center at <em>a</em>, and pulled through the pipe,
double; by means of the loop of the slip to the card. Upon
unbending the card the puzzle will be complete, and appear
as represented in Fig. 1.</p>

<blockquote><p>P R S V R Y P R F C T M N<br />
V R K P T H S P R C P T S T N.</p></blockquote>

<p>The two lines above were affixed to the communion table
of a small church in Wales, and continued to puzzle the
learned congregation for several centuries, but at length
the inscription was deciphered. What was it?</p>


<p class="p6">45. THE PUZZLING RINGS.</p>

<p>This perplexing invention is of great antiquity, and was
treated on by Cardan, the mathematician, at the beginning
of the sixteenth century. It consists of a flat piece of thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
metal or bone, with ten holes in it; in each hole a wire is
loosely fixed, beaten out into a head at one end, to prevent
its slipping through, and the other fastened to a ring, also
loose. Each wire has been passed through the ring of
the next wire, previously to its own ring being fastened on;
and through the whole of the rings runs a wire loop or bow,
which also contains, within its oblong space, all the wires
to which the rings are fastened; the whole presenting so
complicated an appearance, as to make the releasing the
rings from the bow appear an impossibility. The construction
of it would be found rather troublesome to the amateur,
but it may be purchased at most of the toy shops very
lightly and elegantly made. It also exists in various parts
of the country, forged in iron, perhaps by some ingenious
village mechanic, and aptly named "The Tiring Irons."
The following instructions will show the principle on which
the puzzle is constructed, and will prove a key to its
solution.</p>

<p>Take the loop in your left hand, holding it at the end, B,
and consider the rings as being numbered 1st to 10th. The
1st will be the extreme ring to the right, and the 10th the
nearest your left hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_280.jpg" width="500" height="132" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It will be seen that the difficulty arises from each ring
passing round the wire of its right-hand neighbor. The
extreme ring at the right hand, of course, being unconnected
with any other wire than its own, may at any time be drawn
off the end of the bow at A, raised up, dropped through the
bow, and finally released. After you have done this, try to
pass the second ring in the same way, and you will not succeed,
as it is obstructed by the wire of the first ring; but
if you bring the first ring on again, by reversing the process
by which you took it off, viz., by putting it up through the
bow, and on to the end of it, you will then find that by taking
the first and second rings together, they will both draw
off, lift up, and drop through the bow. Having done this,
try to pass the third ring off, and you will not be able;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
because it is fastened on one side to its own wire, which is
within the bow, and on the other side to the second ring,
which is without the bow. Therefore, leaving the third ring
for the present, try the fourth ring, which is now at the end
all but one, and both of the wires which affect it being
within the bow, you will draw it off without obstruction;
and, in doing this, you will have to slip the third ring off,
which will not drop through for the reasons before given;
so, having dropped the fourth ring through, you can only
slip the third ring on again. You will now comprehend
that (with the exception of the first ring) the only ring
which can at any time be released is that which happens to
be second on the bow, at the right-hand end; because both
the wires which affect it being within the bow, there will
be no impediment to its dropping through. You have now
the first and second rings released, and the fourth also&mdash;the
third still fixed; to release which we must make it last
but one on the bow, and to effect which pass the first and
second rings together through the bow, and on to it; then
release the first ring again by slipping it off and dropping
it through, and the third ring will stand as second on the
bow, in its proper position for releasing, by drawing the
second and third off together, dropping the third through,
and slipping the second on again. Now to release the
second, put the first up, through and on the bow; then slip
the two together off, raise them up, and drop them through.
The sixth will now stand second, consequently in its proper
place for releasing; therefore draw it toward the end, A,
slip the fifth off, then the sixth, and drop it through; after
which replace the fifth, as you cannot release it until it
stands in the position of a second ring; in order to effect
this you must bring the first and second rings together,
through and on to the bow; then in order to get the third
on, slip the first off and down through the bow; then bring
the third up, through and on to the bow; then bring the first
ring up and on again, and, releasing the first and second
together, bring the fourth through and on to the bow, replacing
the third; then bring the first and second together
on, drop the first off and through, then the third the same,
replace the first on the bow, take off the first and second
together, and the fifth will then stand second, as you desired;
draw it toward the end, slip it off and through, replace the
fourth, bring the first and second together up and on again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
release the first, bring on the third, passing the second ring
on to the bow again, replace the first, in order to release
the first and second together; then bring the fourth toward
the end, slipping it off and through, replace the third, bring
the first and second together up and on again, release the
first, then the third, replacing the second, bring the first up
and on, in order to release the first and second together,
which having done, your eighth ring will then stand second,
consequently you can release it, slipping the seventh on
again. Then to release the seventh, you must begin by
putting the first and second up and on together, and going
through the movements in the same succession as before,
until you find you have only the tenth and ninth on the bow;
then slip the tenth off and through the bow, and replace
the ninth. This dropping of the tenth ring is the first
effectual movement toward getting the rings off, as all the
changes you have gone through were only to enable you to
get at the tenth ring. You will then find that you have
only the ninth left on the bow, and you must not be discouraged
on learning, that in order to get that ring off, all
the others to the right hand must be put on again, beginning
by putting the first and second together, and working
as before, until you find that the ninth stands as second on
the bow, at which time you can release it. You will then
have only the eighth left on the bow; you must again put
on all the rings to the right hand, beginning by putting up
the first and second together, till you find the eighth standing
as second on the bow, or in its proper position for releasing;
and so you proceed until you find all the rings
finally released. As you commence your operations with all
the rings ready fixed on the bow, you will release the tenth
ring in one hundred and seventy moves; but as you then
have only the ninth on, and as it is necessary to bring on
again all the rings up to the ninth, in order to release the
ninth, and which requires fifteen moves more, you will, consequently,
release the ninth ring in two hundred and fifty-six
moves; and, for your encouragement, your labor will
diminish, by one half, with each following ring which is
finally released. The eighth comes off in one hundred and
twenty-eight moves, the seventh in sixty-four moves, and so
on, until you arrive at the second and first rings, which
come off together, making six hundred and eighty-one
moves, which are necessary to take off all the rings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>.
With the experience you will by this time have acquired,
it is only necessary to say, that to replace the rings, you
begin by putting up the first and second together, and follow
precisely the same system as before.</p>


<p class="p6">46. MOVING THE KNIGHT OVER ALL THE SQUARES ALTERNATELY.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_283.jpg" width="443" height="440" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>EULER'S METHOD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The problem respecting the placing the knight on
any given square, and moving him from that square
to any house on the board, has not been thought unworthy
the attention of the first mathematicians. Euler,
Ozanam, De Montmart, De Moivre, De Majron, and
others, have all given methods by which this feat might be
accomplished. It was reserved, however, for the present
century to lay this down on a general plan; and the only
English writer who has noticed this is Mr. George Walker,
in his <cite>Treatise on Chess</cite>. The plan is this: Let the knight
be placed on any square, and move him from square to
square, on the principle of always playing him to that
point, from which, in actual play, he would command the
fewest other squares; observing, that in reckoning the
squares commanded by him you must omit such as he has
already covered. If, too, there are two squares, on both of
which his powers would be equal, you may move him to
either. Try this on the board, with some counters or waf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>ers,
placing one on every square; and, when you <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'clearl'">clearly</ins>
understand it, you may astonish your friends by inviting
them to station the knight on any square they like, and engaging
to play him, from that square, over the remaining
sixty-three in sixty-three moves. When the automaton
Chessplayer was last exhibited in England, this was made
part of the wonders he accomplished, though as the above
plan was not then known here, he could not adopt it, but
used something like the method laid down by Euler, and
which we subjoin.</p>

<p>Our young Chess-players must remember that it does not
matter on which square the knight is placed at starting;
as, by acquiring the plan by heart, which is soon done, he
can play him over all the squares from any given point, his
last square being at the distance of a knight's move from
his first. It is obvious that this route may be varied many
ways, and we have often amused ourselves by trying to
work it on a slate.</p>


<p class="p6">ANOTHER METHOD.</p>

<p>The problem of the knight's covering successively each
square of the board, has, in all ages, attracted the attention
of the first mathematicians; it is only lately, however, that
this very ingenious system for performing the feat without
seeing the board, has been invented by an Edinburgh
gentleman. We well recollect the surprise occasioned
among chess-amateurs when it was first performed; indeed
it was generally considered a greater mental effort than
that of playing three games of chess at the same time, without
seeing the board.</p>

<p>The general rule for moving the Knight upon all the
squares of the board, is to commence by moving him to that
square which commands the fewest points of attack, and by
continuing this principle he will occupy all the squares in
rotation, observing, that if on any two or more squares his
power would be equal, he may be placed indifferently on
either of such squares. Thus we see, that there are different
routes which the Knight-errant may take in his progress
over all the board; still, whichever of these routes for covering
the sixty-four squares may be adapted, each move
forms, if we may so express ourselves, a link in an endless
chain, so that whatever square we start from, by taking
one known route, we are sure to arrive at a square, the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
link of the chain, a Knight's move distant from the square
of our departure. Consequently, if any person could commit
to memory the consecutive moves of any one route over
the board, he would be able to start from any one square in
that route, in the same manner that any of us, if required
to mention the numerals up to sixty-four, could as easily
start at thirty and end at twenty-nine, as if we started at
one and ended at sixty-four.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_285.jpg" width="500" height="511" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These considerations greatly reduce the apparent impossibility
of performing the feat; but the reader will exclaim,
"What an immense undertaking it would be, to commit to
memory the moves forming a Knight's route over the sixty-four
squares!" and we reply, "Certainly it would be, if we
used the language of Chess to designate the squares;" and
herein lies the beauty of the invention. A set of names,
whose application can be understood at a glance, are invented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
for the squares, and the performer of the feat, having
learned a route of the Knight, expressed by these invented
names, thinks in the new language which he directs the
moves in the terms of chess&mdash;just as many of us <em>think</em> in
English, when we are writing or speaking French.</p>

<p>The diagram given above represents the chess-board;
the distinction of white and black squares is not necessary
for our purpose. The files, commencing from the right hand
are distinguished by the consonants in alphabetical succession
(C and J are, for obvious reasons, omitted.) Thus, the
King's rook's file is known as B, the King's Knight's as D,
the King's Bishops as F, the King's as G, the Queen's as
H, the Queen's Bishop's as K, the Queen's Knight's as L,
and the Queen's Rook's as M. This is all that has to be
learned, in this system of Chess notation; for the lines of
squares tell their own numbers&mdash;one being <em>un</em>, two <em>oo</em>, three
<em>ee</em>, four <em>or</em>, six <em>ix</em>, seven <em>en</em>, eight <em>et</em>&mdash;being, in fact, the terminal
sounds of the first eight numerals. Bun being B <em>one</em>,
or King's Rook's square; Gix, G <em>six</em>, or King's sixth square.
We consider it quite unnecessary to say another word in
explanation of this system; its ingenious simplicity causes
it to be understood and learned at a glance. All that is
required now is, to select a Knight's route over all the
squares of the board, and commit it to memory, not in the
complicated terms of Chess, but in these simple equivalents.
Suppose we start from the Queen's Knights seventh square,
<em>len</em>, the route will be as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Len  het  fen  bet.  Dix  bor  doo  gun<br />
Koo  mun  lee  kun.  Moo  kee  goo  dun.<br />
Bee  div  ben  fet.  Hen  let  mix  lor.<br />
Hee  kiv  gor  hix.  Liv  men  ket  gen.<br />
Kix  giv  fee  hor.  Gix  for  hiv  gee.<br />
Fiv  den  biv  dee.  Bun  foo  hun  loo.<br />
Mor  lix  met  ken.  Get  fix  det  bix.<br />
Dor  boo  fun  hoo.  Lun  mee  kor  miv</p></blockquote>

<p>The only trouble is to commit this cabalistical-looking
table to memory, which may be all accomplished in half
an hour; the process will be greatly facilitated by the
learner frequently playing the route over on the chess-board.
He will be amply rewarded by the astonishment he
will cause to the <em>natives</em> of his locality, who may have the
great misfortune of being unacquainted with our book's enlightening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
pages; and, if not quite a first-rate player, he will
acquire an intimate knowledge of the peculiar powers and

<p>This puzzle, being one for the purpose of constructing different
figures by arranging variously-shaped pieces of card
or wood in certain ways, requires no
separate explanation. Cut out of very
stiff cardboard, or thin mahogany, which
is decidedly preferable, seven pieces, in
shape like the annexed figures and
bearing the same proportion to each
other; one piece must be made in the
shape of figure 1, one of figure 2, and one of figure 3, and
two of each of the other figures. The combinations of which
these figures are susceptible, are almost infinite; and we
subjoin a representation of a few of the most curious. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to be borne in mind, that all the pieces of which the puzzle
consists, must be employed to form each figure.</p>


<p class="p6">50. TROUBLE-WIT.</p>

<p>Take a sheet of stiff paper, fold it down the middle of the
sheet, longways; then turn down the edge of each fold outward,
the breadth of a penny; measure it as it is folded,
into three equal parts, with compasses, which make six divisions
in the sheet; let each third part be turned outward,
and the other, of course, will fall right; then pinch it a
quarter of an inch deep, in plaits, like a ruff, so that, when
the paper lies pinched in its form, it is in the fashion represented
by A; when closed together, it will be like B; unclose
it again, shuffle it with each hand, and it will resemble the
shuffling of a pack of cards; close it and turn each corner
inward with your fore finger and thumb, it will appear as a
rosette for a lady's shoe, as C; stretch it forth, and it will
resemble a cover for an Italian couch, as D; let go your
fore finger at the lower end, and it will resemble a wicket,
as E; close it again, and pinch it at the bottom, spreading
the top, and it will represent a fan, as F; pinch it half
way, and open the top, and it will appear in the form shown
by G; hold it in that form, and with the thumb of your left
hand turn out the next fold, and it will be as H.</p>

may be made to assume an infinite variety of forms, and be
productive of very considerable amusement.</p>

<p class="p6">1. THE CHINESE CROSS ANSWER.</p>

<p>Place Nos. 1 and 2 close together, as in Fig. 1; then hold
them together with the finger and thumb of the left hand
horizontally and with the square hole to the right. Push
No. 3&mdash;placed in the same position <em>facing you</em> (<em>a</em>) in No. 4&mdash;through
the opening at K, and slide it to the left at A, so
that the profile of the pieces should be as in Fig. 2. Now
push No. 4 <em>partially</em> through the space from below upwards,
as seen in f, Fig. 2. Place No. 5 cross-ways upon the part
Y, so that the point R is directed upwards to the right hand
side; then push No. 4 quite through, and it will be in the
position shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 2. All that now
remains is to push No. 6&mdash;which is the key&mdash;through the
opening M and the cross is completed as in Fig. 3.</p>

card for this puzzle must be cut very neatly,
the puzzle handled gently, and great care
taken that, in doubling the card to put on

<p>Draw the loop well down, slipping either ball through it.
Push it through the hole at the extremities, pass it over the

be repeated with the other ball; the loop can then be drawn
through the hole in the center, and the ball will slide along
the cord until it reaches the other side. The string is then
replaced, having both balls on the same side.</p>

<p>There is another and perhaps a neater way of performing

<p>An almost endless source of amusement, combining at the
same time a considerable amount of instruction, may be obtained
in the following manner. Take a card or piece of
pasteboard, or even stiff paper, and draw upon it the form
of an egg&mdash;an oval in outline. The dimensions of the oval
are immaterial, and the experimenter may suit his own fancy
in this respect. With a stout needle, or tracing point, prick
quite through the outline, for the purposes of tracing. Some
of our readers may be unacquainted with the mode of
tracing an outline, and it may be advisable to particularize
one method among many. Having pricked out the oval
upon the card, get a little red or black lead, powdered, and
placing the card upon apiece of drawing paper&mdash;any white
paper will however do&mdash;rub it over the pricked-out oval,
which will be found to be transferred to the white paper
beneath, thus:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 94px;">
<img src="images/i_303.jpg" width="94" height="121" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The powder may be applied either with a piece
of wool or wadding, or by means of a dry camel's-hair
pencil; care should be taken not to let the
tracing-powder get beyond the edge of the pricked
card, as in that case a soiled, dirty appearance is
given to the tracing. The pierced card will serve,
if carefully done, for hundreds of tracings, and it is
obviously the best plan to take a little extra pains with that
in the first instance.</p>

<p>With this traced oval for a basis, (a little further on
we shall speak of other figures, to be used singly or in combination
with each other) any one with a very little skill
will be able to form an infinite number of objects.</p>

<p>The best drawing tool will be found to be an ordinary
black lead pencil.</p>

<p>Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are very easy results, suggestive
also of others. The rules of procedure are the same in all.
Leaving the traced-out oval at first in its dotted form, with
the pencil you draw a horizontal line <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'as'">as</ins> the basis of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
figure. Let this and the other lines, which serve merely as
the scaffolding of your figure, be done faintly or in dots.
Next, draw a line through the center of the oval and
perpendicular to the first. These will ensure your making
the object square and properly balanced. After this you
may draw lines parallel to the others: but these are not so
material, although they serve as guides.</p>

</div>

<p>Now the imagination and fancy may step in to produce
forms having the oval for a foundation; and not only is a
very rational source of amusement opened out, but the
opportunity is given to a cultivation of the noble art of design,
whether as applied to utility or ornament.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_305a.jpg" width="334" height="214" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is obvious to remark that the hand of many an amateur
artist will <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'readly'">readily</ins> be able to form the oval without having
recourse to the pierced card; but as this portion of our
work is intended for <em>all</em>, we have suggested the above mode
as sure to succeed under every circumstance.</p>

<p>Following the same plan in every particular, we subjoin
some examples of what may be done with the square.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_305b.jpg" width="292" height="344" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The dotted lines (<em>figs.</em> 7, 8) represent the traced or
sketched square and plan lines; the firmer lines suggest
objects formed upon that figure. In the same way the thin
square outline (<em>fig.</em> 9) suggests the inner sketch of a
church.</p>

<p>I stated before that the size of the fundamental oval or
square made little difference; but I would recommend my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
younger readers to get these as large as possible, or convenient.
If a large black board, such as is used in most
schools, could be obtained, and the tracings prepared proportionably
large (pounded chalk being used instead of the
black or red powder in transferring the forms <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'therto'">thereto</ins>), and
the designs made upon these with a piece of chalk, so much
the better. However, this matters little; and each one will
suit his or her own taste in that respect. I now proceed to
submit some examples of what may be done with other
rudimentary forms.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_306.jpg" width="247" height="474" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Following the instructions previously given, in place of
the square suggested in Figs. 7, 8, 9, describe a circle.
This may be done with a pair of compasses, or simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
sketched or traced by means of any round object, such as
a coin laid flat upon the paper. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Fig'">Figs</ins>. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
are given merely as suggestions, the circle forming an important
part of their figure. The mind of the experimenter
will immediately revert to other objects&mdash;thousands such
are to be met with around us&mdash;having the circle or the
sphere for their basis. And it will be no mean result of my
labors, if any number of my younger readers are led thereby
to a habit of observation, whereby they will not fail to
notice that nearly all natural objects have the curved line
for a basis, if they are not actually distinguishable thereby
from those that are artificial.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Fig. 16 is drawn upon two circles in combination with
each other. The dotted lines of the plan will be readily perceived;
but lest there should be any difficulty, they have
been drawn separately in Fig. 17. With this <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'uplex'">duplex</ins> figure
little skill will be required to present the lord of the farm
yard. The three outlines, Figs. 18, 19, 20, are based upon
the square turned diamond-wise, and will need no further
remark: examples upon this plan may be multiplied easily.
Those given will serve as hints in the several <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'direetions'">directions</ins> of
flowers, foliage, and landscapes generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_308a.jpg" width="274" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Before proceeding to show what may easily be done by
a simple combination of the figures we have constructed,
<em>i. e.</em>, the oval, square, and circle, let me introduce another,
which enters, by a kind of natural law, into almost all forms
or groups of forms, namely, the triangle. Observe in the
annexed cut, Fig. 21, how naturally, although unconsciously,
the girl seats herself within one.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_308b.jpg" width="302" height="281" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A moment's reflection will show, that from the little nymph
in the cut to the great pyramid, everything that rests solidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
upon the earth must take the form, more or less, of this
broad-based tapering figure. Roofs of houses, churches, and
towers, are all triangular in their form, as are all great
trees, differing from each other only in the width of their
angles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_309a.jpg" width="272" height="230" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Construct a triangle,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and trace it according to former directions,
and from the examples, Figs. 22, 23, 24, look
around you for others, and make various exercises upon this
foundation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_309b.jpg" width="305" height="232" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Now, to proceed to something more complicated. Suppose
you had either in your mind, or sketched out upon paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the plan of a garden; that is to say, suppose you had
the dimensions of a piece of ground, and intended to lay it
out as a garden, allotting so much space to this and that
bed, so much to gravel walks, and wanted to see how such
an arrangement would look in perspective,&mdash;in other words,
in reality, for perspective, however alarming it may look in
books, with its net-work of lines, cross and across, like an
insoluble riddle or a monster cobweb, is nothing more than
the actual representation of things as they meet the eye.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_310a.jpg" width="243" height="371" alt="25" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_310b.jpg" width="237" height="136" alt="26" />
</div>

<p>Let your plan be what is
shown in the square portion of
Fig. 25; at the top of this plan
place your triangle, draw a line
through the center of the square
upwards, until it meets the top A
of the triangle. Next draw lines
from the corner of the beds parallel to the center line until
they meet the base line of the triangle. From thence continue
all these lines to the point A. These give you the
width of the beds <em>in perspective</em>. The other sides of their figure
may be easily enough found. Fig. 26 is the perspective
view sought, and is what your experimental drawing would
be if, having done the plan and guide-lines in pencil and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
rest in pen and ink, you had erased the former with a piece
of india rubber.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_311a.jpg" width="329" height="276" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>27</p></div>
</div>

<p>I do not know whether my readers regard the matter in
the same light, but it appears to the present writer that this
little figure&mdash;the triangle&mdash;is capable of working wonders
in the hands of an amateur draughtsman, if only properly
used. Of course, those regularly educated, or submitted to a
long course of training as artists, are not referred to, but only
the general public, which by the by, means nineteen out
of every twenty individuals. I ask whether the preceding
cut is any exaggeration on the average sort of result attained,
not only amongst very juvenile experimenters, but
those of maturer age?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_311b.jpg" width="333" height="288" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>28</p></div>
</div>

<p>Everybody possessed of vision can tell, ordinarily, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
a building or other object is upright, or in the position proper
to it, or necessary to its stability. By accustoming the hand
to form lines, ovals, circles, squares, and triangles, and by
habituating the mind to form comparisons between objects,
and these and other figures, a person is put imperceptibly,
as it were, in the way of depicting them with accuracy.</p>

<p>To proceed&mdash;let us take the above misrepresented country
residence, and applying to it the previously given rules, see
what we can make of it. We would first draw or trace the
parallelogram shown in dotted lines; over this, we place
a triangle; then drawing an upright line through the center
of both, make that the base of another and lengthened triangle,
as shown (see Fig. <a href="#Page_312">28</a>). Thus we get the three lines
of the side and roofs; and if we knew the proportionate
height of the side window, by marking the same at a, b, and
carrying the lines from those points to the apex of the triangle,
we get its true perspective dimensions.</p>

<p>The difference between the two results is as great as possible.</p>

<p>In Fig. 29 the triangle placed at the side of the soldier in
front gives the perspective of the whole line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;">
<img src="images/i_312.jpg" width="560" height="316" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. 30 shows how two parallelograms in combination assist
in giving the perspective of a block of stone or bale of
goods.</p>

<p>Fig. 31 exhibits the parallelogram and triangle in combination.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing is more puzzling to the tyro in sketching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
than the interior of rooms and halls. In Fig. 32 a very easy
method is given. Trace the outer parallelogram, and within
it, a smaller one; then connect the corners of the two as
shown in the cut.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_313a.jpg" width="560" height="291" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_313b.jpg" width="247" height="170" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. 33 is the application of the preceding.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_313c.jpg" width="293" height="194" alt="" />
</div>

<p>By the present paper I intend to let you into a great secret,
the secret, namely, of Comic or "Funny" Drawing&mdash;a
method, in fact, which is at the bottom of all humorous, or
caricature sketching. Don't let any one be alarmed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
suppose that it is intended to set you quizzing and caricaturing
your friends. Far from it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/i_314a.jpg" width="326" height="205" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Draw the oval, Fig. 34. Divide it by transverse lines into
about equal portions. You have now the basis for a face.
Let the central line (across) mark the position of the eyes,
the line above that the top of the forehead, the one below
the bottom of the nose. By Fig. 35 you will see this worked
out, and have what is considered a well proportioned face.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_314b.jpg" width="187" height="213" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Now oddity of feature or expression
is simply the result of a deviation from
this regularity; and if, as you will
perceive by the other Figs., 36, 37
and 38, these lines are placed higher
or lower, or out of their, strictly speaking,
<em>proper places</em>, you have, as a necessary
result of such disarrangement,
oddity, or comicality, which is
founded upon irregularity or incongruity
in things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 302px;">
<img src="images/i_314c.jpg" width="302" height="204" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I shall carry out this hint more fully, at present merely
pointing out, in reference to the next two figures, how the
end is attained by placing a pair of dark spectacles upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
regularly-featured face, or adding a little flesh to the lower
portion of that at Fig. 39.</p>

<p>But not to forget the "Art" in the "Sport," let me add,
that by sketching the plain oval, and remarking whereabout
the lines of their features would cut it, you may, without
difficulty, attempt likenesses of your friends and companions.</p>

<p>Now fill your slates or sketch-books with ovals, and try
the effects of which the above are but indications. Your imaginations
will furnish an endless variety of subjects. The
omission of one eye, or its being covered by a shade, or
closed while the other stares; the nose slightly on one side,
the mouth a little wider than usual&mdash;these are all sources of
the humorous, which, however, is far from being heightened
by <em>ugliness</em>. Indeed, it should be borne in mind, that great
distortion or hideousness, so far from contributing to humor,
destroys it by raising painful images in the mind.
True humor is closely allied to kindness.</p>

<p>Now let us take the simplest elements of the profile or
side face. This is also formed upon the oval, with a slight
variation. And here we must go a
little more into the "Art" than at first
sight the "Sport" seems to warrant.
You will perceive by Fig. 41 that the
oval used for profile purposes is divided
as before into four about equal
portions, which are appropriated in
the same manner. That is to say, the
central line across is for the eye, and
the other two for the limit of the hair
and the bottom of the nose.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_315.jpg" width="197" height="206" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But take notice that portions are cut off&mdash;<em>e. g.</em>, at the back
where the neck is inserted; a little has to be added for forehead,
chin, and hair; and some modification takes place
about the region of the eye.</p>

<p>Suffice it that the oval forms essentially the basis of the
structure of a well proportioned face, such as is shown in
the Fig. (41). Draw for yourself, or trace from Fig. 41, a
figure for your basis. Next make a number of these tracings
upon a clean sheet of drawing paper, and marking
them in very lightly, in pencil, proceed as directed in the case
of the front face in the last lesson; altering the feature
lines, lengthening or shortening the chin, nose, and forehead
according to your fancy. This will be a sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
guide for you, and illustrations <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'o'">of</ins> this are accordingly omitted
here.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_316a.jpg" width="360" height="245" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Let us proceed a step further. The last hint only dealt
with the depth relatively of the several parts of the face.
Now, as to their prominence. How very easily, by means
of a few magic touches, which, by this time, you are magicians
enough to impart, may you summon up our ancient
acquaintance Mother Hubbard, or the modern hero Punch.
(See Figs. 42, 43.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_316b.jpg" width="315" height="230" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Observe that the peculiarity of these comic physiognomies
consists merely in their deviation from the regularly formed
head of Fig. 41. They are constructed upon that figure,
which may be seen underneath in dotted lines. The variety
of ways in which this exercise may be worked is infinite.
Subjoined are a few. In Figs. 44 and 45, beards, mustaches,
eyebrows, the hair cut absurdly short, or left redundant,
joined to the sinking in of the facial angle, produce the
effect of comicality. In Figs. 46, 47, the same end is attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
by the simplest means, and with even less exaggeration.
And here I again repeat, that the less deviation there
is from the proper proportions the better.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_317a.jpg" width="500" height="310" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>46</p></div>
</div>

<p>As a pendant to the comical landscape given No. 27 I
give you the annexed (Fig. 48).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_317b.jpg" width="494" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>48</p></div>
</div>

<p>Every one will recognize it as a model drawing&mdash;such
as is to be found upon walls, and occasionally upon the
margins of school-books. This the artist (!) intends from a
comic drawing. Of course it is no such thing.</p>

<p>We will new take up the grandest object of art the
Human Figure. In <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'desigining'">designing</ins> the human figure, there
are three principal rules to be observed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>First, the standard height of the human body may be reckoned
as eight times the length of the face. Dividing the
entire length by eight, as shown in the annexed diagram
(Fig. 49), it will be perceived that the face comprises one
of the spaces: the second reaching to the chest: the third,
to above the hips; the fourth cuts the entire length into two
equal parts; the fifth extends to the center of the thigh:
the sixth, to the knee joint; the seventh to half way down
the leg; and the eighth, to the sole of the foot.</p>

<p>The second rule is, that no part of the body, viewed
laterally, is more than twice the thickness of the head. In
very young children, however, the rule is, that where the
head will go, any part of the body will follow, as the experience
of most people has tested.</p>

<p>The third rule concerns the center of gravity. By reference
to the fig. (49), a vertical line will be perceived,
drawn through the center of the figure. Whenever the
body is at rest upon its legs, standing at ease, as one may
say, this imaginary line must always pass through its center.</p>

<p>We shall see more about this hereafter, at present confining
ourselves to the consideration of the first two rules
These must be considered as only generally true.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_318.jpg" width="292" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>50</p></div>
</div>

<p>They have, however, to be well considered in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
with our present subject; for as we said with the face, any
great deviation from them leads to oddity, and is at the
root of caricature drawing.</p>

<p>Trace out, or sketch out any size, the figures (Fig. 49 and
50), or any others for yourselves: or taking any well drawn
figure in a print which may not be too costly to use so, draw
with a black lead pencil upon the print similar lines to those
in the figures, that is to say, divide its length into eight
parts, first dropping a central line perpendicular to the
ground.</p>

<p>You will thus test the accuracy of the rule, and familiarize
yourself with the proportions of the figure. Then, for the
purpose of comic drawing, you will vary these proportions.
A face too long or too short, a body too large or too small
for the legs, or legs otherwise disproportionate to the rest
of the body, will yield the desired results. It will be seen
by the Figs. 51 and 52 that their oddity has been arrived
at simply by this rule, or by the deviation from the strict
rule of proportion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_319.jpg" width="550" height="375" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>51</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 53 is given in illustration of the remarks upon the
second rule. The form is correct enough as regards
height, and deviates in the matter of lateral proportion.</p>

<p>We now come to consider the third principle&mdash;that of
the center of gravity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Observe in the annexed figures how the first (<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Fig.'">Fig. 54</ins>)
being at rest, commends itself to the reason like a mathematical
demonstration. The next diagram shows a partial
deviation from the center of gravity, is in a false position,
and we begin either to pity or to laugh&mdash;poor diagram!
The two following figures are other cases of the same sort&mdash;we
feel instinctively for them&mdash;they are very far gone.
Try this rule upon your
slates or sketching blocks;
and after that we will go
on to the next subject.
In the diagrams (Figs. 58,
59), the same principle is
enforced. The first is at
rest, because the line passing
through the center of
the figure is a vertical
line. In the next figure,
that line being out of the vertical, the
balance is disturbed, and the figure
topples; so with the next. This is so
plain that argument is not needed to
demonstrate it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_320a.jpg" width="400" height="359" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_320b.jpg" width="310" height="220" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_320c.jpg" width="250" height="239" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Try this also for yourselves as before.
Nor need we confine our experiments
to figures comparatively at rest: forms
in every variety of action come under
the same rule&mdash;it is a law of nature.
There is a central line drawn through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the whole system of the universe, through every tree, and
plant, and stone, and every upright thing, could we but see it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_321a.jpg" width="300" height="414" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The first of the following
figures is in full action, but
it may go on for ever, as
its balance is not in any
way disturbed. The second
is fast hastening to its
fall. The third is much
nearer still to that consummation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_321b.jpg" width="269" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It will suggest itself to
every reader to apply the
rule to other objects than
the human figure. Trees
in the positions of Figs.
64 and 65 are never seen
unless through some violent
accident; they may
bend, and twist, and meander,
but taking the objects
as a whole, a central
line, vertical to the horizon,
will be detected, as
shown in Fig. 65.</p>

<p>If we turn our attention
in any direction upon
natural objects, the clouds, the earth, the sea, flowers, trees,
or animal bodies, we cannot fail to see that <em>a curved line</em>
is always to be made out in their forms. Indeed, just so
far as they are graceful and pleasing objects to the eye, this
curved line is distinguishable. On the contrary, square
lines offend the eye when met with under such circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
It is almost impossible indeed to imagine a square cloud,
a square flower, or a square horse. When we see a square
headed man, we are not impressed in his favor. We may
have met with representations of natural objects, such as
rocks, hill tops, mountain precipices, and the like, which had
a square or nearly square appearance; but such things are
almost always presented to our view as phenomena&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>
things violating the regular order or general rule of nature.
This curved line, which is the line of beauty, must pervade
all nature; it is the natural law; and we cannot sufficiently
admire the truth that that which is most necessary
is also most beautiful.</p>

<p>Does any one ask what particular reference these observations
have to "Art in Sport?" Let us say that they alone
can properly understand what is comic who have learned to
appreciate what is <em>not</em> comic. The distance between the
sublime and the ridiculous is said to be very small&mdash;only
one step. At any rate, the student who best understands
the first will best appreciate the second. Socrates did not
disdain to write an essay upon this subject, insisting that
the very same qualities were essential in the comic and the
tragic artist. But this is digressive.</p>

<p>Let us resume: In the annexed figure (67)
you perceive the curved line. In proportion
as you are able to make this perfectly, you
will succeed in drawing gracefully. I must presume that
very many of my readers will have no difficulty in copying
the few natural objects suggested below. Practice upon
your slate or board the figure (67) until you can do it easily.
Then, for the purposes of "sport," proceed as follows.
You wish to produce a droll "bit" of landscape. Take any
simple view, such as submitted in Fig. 68.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_322b.jpg" width="560" height="379" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>68</p></div>
</div>

<p>In this you will readily
discover, as I said above,
the curved, graceful lines
of beauty&mdash;in the clouds,
the outline of the distant
hills, the foliage, the
meandering stream. Let
me advise you to practice
this lesson somewhat perseveringly;
apart from the
new source of amusement which it is the object of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
papers to open up, a beautiful lesson could be impressed
upon the mind. Nothing is more calculated to refine the mind,
to ennoble the thoughts, than to withdraw one's self from the
artificial world, and to gaze upon the fresh face of nature.
And if we are able to do this intelligently&mdash;in other words,
if, having learned the alphabet, we are able to peruse as it
were the book of nature&mdash;the delight and the advantage
is proportionably increased. Now turn to the example
shown in Fig. 69. What do we see? The lines of beauty
have given place to others less pleasing to the eye, and (except
as a source of merriment) less acceptable to the mind.
Fig. 69 is a comic landscape; how it has become so must
be clearly apparent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_323a.jpg" width="450" height="348" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In Fig. 70, the same process is carried out, and the result
is similar.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_323b.jpg" width="465" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I hope that I shall not be understood to mean, that in order
to be graceful everything must be round, or that everything
round is graceful, or that every square object is ungraceful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
or, again, that by making any curved line into a
square or straight one the end we propose is to be obtained.
Doubtless many round things are ungraceful, as many others
composed entirely of straight lines at various angles to each
other are exceedingly graceful. But what is meant is this:
that natural objects, in which, left to themselves, the curved
line predominates, are made odd and comic-looking when
drawn upon the square.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/i_324a.jpg" width="348" height="251" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In Fig. 71, not only the lines of the shepherd's form are
curved lines, and, therefore, conducive in a degree to its
general pleasing character, but the <em>attitude</em> is formed upon
a curved line. This will be perceived clearer by reference
to the next figure, (72,) in which, without using a single
straight line in the parts of the form, the oddity is attained
by making the whole attitude stiff and angular.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i_324b.jpg" width="341" height="269" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The student will find no difficulty in multiplying examples
for himself: those given will suffice as hints. We must now
proceed to show how comic designs may be made and applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
to the slides of magic lanterns. The proper course of
procedure is as follows:</p>

<p>Procure a piece of clear common window glass, without
specks or scratches; let this be made perfectly clean. Prepare
your design, which should be made the exact size you
intend it to be painted upon the glass; color it; and when
quite dry, place it beneath your slide of glass, to which it
might be fastened at the corners by means of a little gum
or varnish. Now commence to paint upon the glass an exact
fac simile of the design, which, of course, you see clearly
enough through the glass.</p>

<p>Common camel's hair brushes will do; those made of sable
are, however, much better; but the first will suffice for
ordinary purposes.</p>

<p>The colors necessary are what are called silica colors,
and are procurable of most artist's color makers.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to let your first colors dry before
putting on your shades; and it is desirable not to work in
too hot a room, as the nature of the varnish with which you
work is to dry very rapidly.</p>

<p>Bear in mind too, that upon glass you cannot wash in a
tint. Broad surfaces, such as skies, must be stippled in, as
in painting upon ivory.</p>

<p>In originating this paper on "The Magic of Art," the author
did not propose to himself to give a complete treatise,
but simply to point out, by some very easy processes, at
source of amusement and instruction, available to almost
every intelligent reader. It is hoped that, in this subject,
he has not entirely failed, and that all will find some entertainment
from,</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_326.jpg" width="464" height="349" alt="" />

<p>The art of communicating secret information by means of
writing, which is intended to be illegible except by the person
for whom it is destined, is very ancient. The ancients
sometimes shaved the head of a slave, and wrote upon the
skin with some indelible coloring matter, and then sent him,
after his hair had been grown again, to the place of his destination.
This is not, however, properly secret writing, but
only a concealment of writing. Another kind, which corresponds
better with the name, is the following, used by the
ancients. They took a small stick, and wound around it
bark or papyrus, upon which they wrote. The bark was
then unrolled and sent to the correspondent, who was furnished
with a stick of the same size. He wound the bark
again round this, and thus was enabled to read what had
been written.</p>

<p>This mode of concealment is evidently very imperfect.
Cryptography properly consists in writing with signs, which
are legible only to him for whom the writing is intended, or
who has a key or explanation of the signs. The most simple
method is to choose for every letter of the alphabet some
sign, or only another letter. But this sort of cryptography
(chiffre) is also easy to be deciphered without a key. Hence
many illusions are used. No separation is made between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the words, or signs of no meaning are inserted between
those of real meaning. Various keys are also used according
to rules before agreed upon. By this means the deciphering
of the writing becomes difficult for a third person
not initiated, but it is also extremely troublesome to the
correspondents themselves, and a slight mistake often makes
it illegible even to them.</p>

<p>Another mode of communicating intelligence secretly,
viz. to agree upon some printed book, and mark the words
out, is also troublesome, and not at all safe. The method
of concealing the words which are to convey the information
intended in matter of a very different character, in a long
letter which the correspondent is enabled to read by applying
a paper to it, with holes corresponding to the places of
the significant words, is attended with many disadvantages:
the paper may be lost, the repetition of certain words may
lead to a discovery, and the difficulty of connecting the important
with the unimportant matter, so as to give to the
whole the appearance of an ordinary letter, is considerable.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of sympathetic inks. They are so
called because the writings or drawings made by them are
illegible, till by the action of some chemical agents, such as
light, heat, acids, or other substances are brought in contact
with them, when they appear. A weak sulphate of iron
will be invisible in writing till washed over with a weak
solution of prussiate of potass, which turns it of a beautiful
blue. If we write with the nitro-muriate of gold, and afterwards
brush the letters over with dilute muriate of tin, the
writing will appear of a beautiful purple. If we write with
a diluted solution of muriate of copper, and when dry present
it to the fire, it will be of a yellow color.</p>

<p>Chemistry was also in great request for secret writing,
and various substances were found to afford a fluid which
would leave no mark behind the pen, until some chemical
agent were applied. For example, if a letter be written
with a pen dipped in the juice of lemon, the words will be
invisible until the paper is held before the fire. This is
caused by the action of the heat. Again, if a solution of
nitrate of iron be the fluid used, the writing cannot be seen
until it is dipped into a solution of galls, or even into tea,
which will act upon the iron, and become ink. It was found
that if a plain sheet of paper were sent, and intercepted,
the very fact of its being plain rendered it suspicious, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
every means were used to render visible any writing that
might be on it. A letter was therefore written with ordinary
ink, on indifferent subjects, and between the lines the
required information was added in some sympathetic ink.
But writing with these or other sympathetic inks is unsafe,
because the agents employed to render them visible are too
generally known. Hence, the chiffre indéchiffrable, as it is
called, has come very much into use, because it is easily
applied, difficult to be deciphered, and the key may be preserved
in the memory and easily changed. It consists of a
table in which the letters of the alphabet, or any other signs
agreed upon, are arranged as follow:</p>

<p>Any word is now taken for a key. The word <em>Paris</em>, for
example. This is a short word, and for the sake of secresy
it would be well to choose for the key some one or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
words less striking. Suppose we wish to write in this
cypher with this key the phrase, "We lost a battle," we
must write <em>Paris</em> over the phrase, repeating it as often as is
necessary, thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pa risP a risPar<br />
We lost a battle.</p></blockquote>

<p>We now take cypher for <em>w</em>, the letter which we find in the
square opposite <em>w</em> in the left margin column, and under <em>p</em> on
the top, which is <em>m</em>. Instead of <em>e</em> we take the letter opposite
<em>e</em>, and under <em>a</em>, which is <em>f</em>; for <em>l</em>, the letter opposite <em>c</em>,
and under <em>z</em>, and so on.</p>

<p>Proceeding thus, we should obtain the following series
of letters:</p>

<blockquote><p>mf cxli b tkmimw</p></blockquote>

<p>The person who receives the epistle writes the key over
the letters</p>

<blockquote><p>P a r i s P a r i s P a r<br />
m f c x l i b t k m i m w</p></blockquote>

<p>He now goes down in the perpendicular line, at the top of
which is <em>p</em>, until he meets <em>m</em>, opposite to which, in the left
marginal column, he finds <em>w</em>. Next, going in the line of <em>a</em>
down to <em>f</em> he finds, on the left, <em>e</em>. In the same way <em>r</em> gives
<em>l</em>, <em>i</em> gives <em>o</em>, and so on. Or you may reverse the process;
begin with <em>p</em>, in the left marginal column, and look along
horizontally till you find <em>m</em>, over which, in the top line,
you will find <em>w</em>. It is easily seen that the same letter is not
always designated by the same cypher; thus <em>e</em> and <em>a</em> occur
twice in the phrase selected, and they are designated respectively
by the cyphers <em>f</em> and <em>w</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>k</em>. Thus the possibility
of finding out the secret writing is almost impossible.</p>

<p>The key may be changed from time to time, and a different
key may be used with each correspondent. The utmost
accuracy is necessary, because one character accidentally
omitted changes the whole cypher. The best way of determining
the key word is to arrange that any word which
occurs at a certain distance from the beginning or end shall
be the key word&mdash;the tenth from the beginning, for example.
The key word will thus change every time, and any combination
of letters will make it. This will make it impossible
to be guessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>The easiest method of working this square is to cut a
piece of thin wood like a carpenter's square, and by applying
it to the alphabet the letter is at once seen in the angle.
For example, supposing such a square to be applied so that
one side is on the letter <em>p</em> at the top, and the other on the
letter <em>w</em> at the left hand, the letter <em>m</em> will be in the angle,
so that the trouble of following the lines with the eye will
be avoided.</p>

<p>Here is another specimen of secret writing.</p>

<p class="p6">THE CIRCULAR CYPHER.</p>

<p>To carry on a correspondence without the possibility of
the meaning of the letter being detected, in case it should
be opened by any other person, has employed the ingenuity
of many. No method will be found more effectual for this
purpose, or more easy, than the following.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_331.jpg" width="313" height="318" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Provide a piece of square card or pasteboard, and draw a
circle on it, which circle is to be divided into 27 equal parts,
in each of which parts must be written <em>one</em> of the capital letters
of the alphabet, and the &amp;, as in the figure. Let the
center of this circle be blank. Then draw another circle,
also divided into 27 equal parts, in each of which write one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of the small letters of the alphabet, and the &amp;. This circle
must be cut round, and made exactly to fit the blank space
in the center of the large circle, and must run round a
pivot or pin. The person with whom you correspond must
have a similar dial, and at the beginning of your letter you
must put the capital letter, and at the end the small letter,
which answer to each other when you have fixed your dial.</p>

<p>Suppose what you wish to communicate is as follows:</p>

<p><em>I am so watched I cannot see you as I promised; but I will
meet you to-morrow in the park, with the letters, &amp;c.</em></p>

<p>You begin with the letter <em>T</em>, and end with the letter <em>m</em>,
which shows how you have fixed the dial, and how your correspondent
must fix his, that he may decipher your letter.
Then, for <em>I am</em>, you write <em>b uf</em>, and so of the rest, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>T b uf lh pumwayx b wugghm lyy rhn ul b
ikhfblyx vnm b pbee fyym rhn mh fhkkhp bg
may iukd pbma may eymmykl, tw.</em></p>

<p><em>m.</em><br />
</p></blockquote>


<p class="p6"><em>Another Way.</em></p>

<p>Take two pieces of card, pasteboard, or stiff paper, through
which you cut long squares at different distances. One of
these you keep yourself, and the other you give to your correspondent.
You lay the pasteboard on a paper, and, in the
spaces cut out write what you would have understood by
him only; then fill the intermediate spaces with any words
that will connect the whole together, and make a different
sense. When he receives it, he lays his pasteboard over the
whole, and those words which are between crotchets [ ]
form the intelligence you wish to communicate. For example:
suppose you want to express these words,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>Don't trust Robert: I have found him a villain.</em>"</p></blockquote>

<p>"[Don't] fail to send my books. I [trust] they will be
ready when [Robert] calls on you. [I have] heard that you
have [found] your dog. I call [him a villain] who stole
him." You may place a pasteboard of this kind three other
ways&mdash;the bottom at top&mdash;the top at bottom, or by turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
it over; but in this case you must previously apprize your
correspondent, or he may not be able to decipher your
meaning.</p>

<img src="images/i_333a.jpg" width="331" height="331" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 2.</p></div>

<p>Form a circle like Fig. 2, divided into twenty-six parts,
with a letter of the alphabet written in each. The interior
of the circle is movable, like that in Fig. 1, and the circumference
is to be ruled like music paper. Place in each division
a note different in figure or position.</p>

<p>Within the musical lines place the three keys, and on the
outer circle the figures to denote time. Then get a ruled
paper, and place one of the keys (suppose <em>ge-re-sol</em>) against
the time 2-4ths, at the beginning of the paper, which will
inform your correspondent how to place his circle. You
then copy the notes that answer to the letters of the words
you intend to write, in the manner expressed above.</p>

<p>The mechanical knowledge of the ancients was principally
theoretical; and though they seem to have executed
some minor pieces of mechanism which were sufficient to
delude the ignorant, yet there is no reason for believing
that they have executed any machinery that was capable
of exciting much surprise, either by its ingenuity or its
magnitude. The properties of the mechanical powers, however,
seem to have been successfully employed in performing
feats of strength which were beyond the reach even of
strong men, and which could not fail to excite the greatest
wonder when exhibited by persons of ordinary size.</p>

<p>Firmus, a native of Seleucia, who was executed by the
Emperor Aurelian for espousing the cause of Zenobia, was
celebrated for his feats of strength. In his account of the
life of Firmus, who lived in the third century, Vopiscus
informs us that he could suffer iron to be forged upon an
anvil placed upon his breast. In doing this, he lay upon
his back, and, resting his feet and shoulders against some
support, his whole body formed an arch, as we shall afterward
more particularly explain. Until the end of the sixteenth
century, the exhibition of such feats does not seem
to have been common. About the year 1703, a native of
Kent, of the name of Joyce, exhibited such feats of strength
in London and other parts of England, that he received the
name of the second Samson. His own personal strength
was very great; but he had also discovered, without the aid
of theory, various positions of his body in which men even
of common strength could perform very surprising feats.
He drew against horses, and raised enormous weights; but
as he actually exhibited his powers in ways which evinced
the enormous strength of his own muscles, all his feats
were ascribed to the same cause. In the course of eight
or ten years, however, his methods were discovered, and
many individuals of ordinary strength exhibited a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
of his principal performances, though in a manner greatly
inferior to Joyce.</p>

<p>Some time afterward, John Charles Van Eckeberg, a
native of Harzgerode, in Anhault, traveled through Europe
under the appellation of Samson, exhibiting very remarkable
examples of his strength. This, we believe, is the
same person whose feats are particularly described by
Dr. Desaguliers. He was a man of the middle size, and of
ordinary strength; and as Dr. Desaguliers was convinced
that his feats were exhibitions of skill, and not of strength
he was desirous of discovering his methods, and, with this
view, he went to see him, accompanied with the Marquis
of Tullibardine, Dr. Alexander Stuart, Dr. Pringle, and his
own mechanical operator. They placed themselves round
the German, so as to be able to observe accurately all that
he did, and their success was so great, that they were able
to perform most of the feats the same evening by themselves,
and almost all the rest when they had provided the
proper apparatus. Dr. Desaguliers exhibited some of the
experiments before the Royal Society, and has given such a
distinct explanation of the principles on which they depend,
that we shall endeavor to give a popular account of them.</p>

</div>

<p>1. The performer sat upon an inclined board <span class="smcapa">A B</span>, placed
upon a frame <span class="smcapa">C D E</span>, with his feet abutting against the upright
board <span class="smcapa">C</span>. Round his loins was placed a strong girdle
<span class="smcapa">FG</span>, to the iron ring of which at <span class="smcapa">G</span> was fastened a rope by
means of a hook. The rope passed between his legs
through a hole in board <span class="smcapa">C</span>, and several men, or two horses,
pulling at the other end of the rope, were unable to draw
the performer out of his place. His hands at <span class="smcapa">G</span> seemed to
pull against the men, but they were of no advantage to him
whatever.</p>

<p>2. Another of the German's feats is shown in Fig. 2.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Having fixed the rope above mentioned to a strong post
at <span class="smcapa">A</span>, and made it pass through a fixed iron eye at <span class="smcapa">B</span>, to the
ring in his girdle, he planted his feet against the post at
<span class="smcapa">B</span>, and raised himself from the ground by the rope, as
shown in the figure. He then suddenly stretched out his
legs and broke the rope, falling back on a feather bed at
<span class="smcapa">C</span>, spread out to receive him.</p>

</div>

<p>3. In imitation of Firmus, he laid himself down on the
ground, as shown in Fig. 3, and when an anvil <span class="smcapa">A</span> was
placed upon his breast, a man hammered with all his force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the piece of iron <span class="smcapa">B</span>, with a sledge hammer, and sometimes
two smiths cut in two with chisels a great cold bar of iron
laid upon the anvil. At other times a stone of huge dimensions,
half of which is shown at <span class="smcapa">C</span>, was laid upon his belly,
and broken with a blow of the great hammer.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_337.jpg" width="424" height="372" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>F<span class="smcapa">IG.</span> 4.</p></div>
</div>

<p>4. The performer then placed his shoulders upon one
chair, and his heels upon another, as in Fig. 4, forming,
with his back-bone, thighs, and legs, an arch springing
from its abutments at <span class="smcapa">A</span> and <span class="smcapa">B</span>. One or two men then stood
upon his belly, rising up and down while the performer
breathed. A stone, one and a half feet long, one foot broad,
and half a foot thick, was then laid upon his belly and
broken by a sledge hammer, an operation which may be
performed with much less danger than when his back
touched the ground, as in Fig. 3.</p>

<p>5. His next feat was to lie down on the ground, as in
Fig. 5. A man being then placed on his knees, he draws
his heels towards his body, and, raising his knees, he lifts
up the man gradually, till, having brought his knees perpendicularly
under him, as in Fig. 6, he raises his own body
up, and, placing his arms around the man's legs, he rises
with him, and sets him down on some low table or eminence
of the same height as his knees. This feat he sometimes
performed with two men in place of one.</p>

</div>

<p>6. The last, and apparently the
most wonderful, performance of the
German, is shown in Fig. 7, where
he appears to raise a cannon <span class="smcapa">A</span>,
placed upon a scale, the four ropes
of the scale being fixed to a rope
or chain attached to his girdle, in
the manner already described. Previous
to the fixing of the ropes, the
cannon and scale rest upon two
rollers <span class="smcapa">B C</span>, but when all is ready, the
two rollers are knocked from beneath
the scale, and the cannon is
sustained by the strength of his
loins.</p>

<p>The German also exhibited his
strength in twisting into a screw
a flat piece of iron like <span class="smcapa">A</span>, Fig. 8.
He first bent the iron into a right
angle, as at <span class="smcapa">B</span>, and then wrapping
his handkerchief about its broad
upper end, he held that end in his
left hand, and with his right applied to the other end,
twisted about the angular point, as shown at <span class="smcapa">C</span>. Lord
Tullibardine succeeded in doing the same thing, and even
untwisted one of the irons which the German had twisted.</p>

<p>It would lead into details by no means popular, were I to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
give a minute explanation of the mechanical principles upon
which these feats depend. A few general observations will
perhaps be sufficient for ordinary readers. The feats No. 1,
2, and 7, depend entirely on the natural strength of the
bones of the pelvis, which form a double arch, which it
would require an immense force to break, by any external
pressure directed to the center of the arch; and, as the
legs and thighs are capable of sustaining four or five thousand
pounds when they stand quite upright, the performer
has no difficulty in resisting the force of two horses, or of
sustaining the weight of a cannon weighing two or three
thousand pounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_339.jpg" width="386" height="302" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>F<span class="smcapa">IG.</span> 8.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The feat of the anvil is certainly a very surprising one.
The difficulty, however, really consists in sustaining the
anvil; for when this is done, the effect of the hammering
is nothing. If the anvil were a thin piece of iron, or even
two or three times heavier than the hammer, the performer
would be killed by a few blows; but the blows are scarcely
felt when the anvil is very heavy, for the more matter the
anvil has, the greater is its inertia, and it is the less liable
to be struck out of its place; for when it has received by
the blow the whole momentum of the hammer, its velocity
will be so much less than that of the hammer, as its quantity
of matter is greater. When the blow, indeed, is struck,
the man feels less of the weight of the anvil than he did
before, because, in the reaction of the stone, all the parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
of it round about the hammer rise towards the blow. This
property is illustrated by the well known experiment of
laying a stick with its ends upon two drinking glasses full
of water, and striking the stick downwards in the middle
with an iron bar. The stick will in this case be broken
without breaking the glasses, or spilling the water. But
if the stick is struck upwards, as if to throw it up in the
air, the glasses will break if the blow be strong, and if the
blow is not very quick, the water will be spilled without
breaking the glasses.</p>

<p>When the performer supports a man upon his belly, as in
Fig. 4, he does it by means of the strong arch formed by
his backbone, and the bones of his legs and thighs. If
there were room for them, he could bear three or four, or, in
their stead, a great stone to be broken with one blow.</p>

<p>A number of feats of real and extraordinary strength
were exhibited about a century ago, in London, by Thomas
Topham, who was five feet ten inches high, and about thirty-one
years of age. He was entirely ignorant of any of the
methods for making his strength appear more surprising;
and he often performed, by his own natural powers, what
he learned had been done by others by artificial means. A
distressing example of this occurred in his attempt to imitate
the feat of the German Samson by pulling against
horses. Ignorant of the method which we have already
described, he seated himself on the ground with his feet
against two stirrups, and by the weight of his body he succeeded
in pulling against a single horse; but in attempting
to pull against two horses, he was lifted out of his
place, and one of his knees was shattered against the stirrups,
so as to deprive him of most of the strength of one
of his legs. The following are the feats of real strength
which Dr. Desaguliers saw him perform.</p>

<p>1. Having rubbed his fingers with coal-ashes to keep
them from slipping, he rolled up a very strong and large
pewter plate.</p>

<p>2. Having laid seven or eight short and strong pieces of
tobacco-pipe on the first and third fingers, he broke them
by the force of his middle finger.</p>

<p>3. He broke the bowl of a strong tobacco-pipe placed
between his first and third fingers, by pressing his fingers
together sideways.</p>

<p>4. Having thrust such another bowl under his garter, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
legs being bent he broke it to pieces by the tendons of his
hams, without altering the bending of his leg.</p>

<p>5. He lifted with his teeth, and held in a horizontal position
for a considerable time, a table six feet long, with half
a hundred weight hanging at the end of it. The feet of the
table rested against his knees.</p>

<p>6. Holding in his right hand an iron kitchen poker three
feet long and three inches round, he struck upon his bare
left arm, between the elbow and the wrist, till he bent the
poker nearly to a right angle.</p>

<p>7. Taking a similar poker, and holding the ends of it in
his hands, and the middle against the back of his neck, he
brought both ends of it together before him, and he then
pulled it almost straight again. This last feat was the
most difficult, because the muscles which separate the arms
horizontally from each other are not so strong as those
which bring them together.</p>

<p>8. He broke a rope about two inches in circumference,
which was partly wound about a cylinder four inches in
diameter, having fastened the other end of it to straps that
went over his shoulder.</p>

<p>9. Dr. Desaguliers saw him lift a rolling stone of about
800 pounds' weight with his hands only, standing in a frame
above it, and taking hold of a frame fastened to it. Hence
Dr. Desaguliers gives the following relative view of the
strengths of individuals:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Strength">
<tr>
 <td class="tdl">Strength of the weakest men,</td>
 <td class="tdr">125</td>

</tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdl">Strength of Topham,</td>
 <td class="tdr">800</td>
 <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The weight of Topham was about 200.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable and inexplicable experiments
relative to the strength of the human frame, which we have
ourselves seen and admired, is that in which a heavy man
is raised with the greatest facility, when he is lifted up the
instant that his own lungs, and those of the persons who
raise him, are inflated with air. This experiment was, I
believe, first shown in England a few years ago by Major
H., who saw it performed in a large party at Venice under
the direction of an officer of the American navy. As Major
H. performed it more than once in my presence, I shall
describe, as nearly as possible, the method which he prescribed.
The heaviest person in the party lies down upon
two chairs, his legs being supported by the one and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
back by the other. Four persons, one at each leg and one
at each shoulder, then try to raise him, and they find his
dead weight to be very great, from the difficulty they experience
in supporting him. When he is replaced in the
chairs, each of the four persons takes hold of the body as
before, and the person to be lifted gives two signals by
clapping his hands. At the first signal he himself and the
four lifters begin to draw a long and full breath, and when
the inhalation is completed, or the lungs filled, the second
signal is given, for raising the person from the chairs. To
his own surprise and that of his bearers, he rises with the
greatest facility, as if he were no heavier than a feather.
On several occasions I have observed that when one of the
bearers performs his part ill, by making the inhalation out
of time, the part of the body which he tries to raise is left,
as it were, behind. As we have repeatedly seen this experiment,
and have performed the part both of the load and
of the bearer, we can testify how remarkable the effects
appear to all parties, and how complete is the conviction,
either that the load has been lightened, or the bearer
strengthened by the prescribed process.</p>

<p>At Venice, the experiment was performed in a much more
imposing manner. The heaviest man in the party was
raised and sustained upon the points of the fore fingers of
six persons. Major H. declared that the experiment would
not succeed if the person lifted were placed upon a board,
and the strength of the individuals applied to the board.
He conceived it necessary that the bearers should communicate
directly with the body to be raised. I have not had
an opportunity of making any experiments relative to these
curious facts; but whether the general effect is an illusion,
or the result of known or of new principles, the subject
merits a careful investigation.</p>

<p>Among the remarkable exhibitions of mechanical strength
and dexterity, we may enumerate that of supporting pyramids
of men. This exhibition is a very ancient one. The
simplest form of this feat consists in placing a number of
men upon each other's shoulders, so that each row consists
of a man fewer till they form a pyramid terminating in a
single person, upon whose head a boy is sometimes placed
with his feet upwards.</p>

<p class="p6">AN ARTIFICIAL MEMORY.</p>

<p>The reader must have observed, that to perform several
of the recreations in this book, it is necessary to have a
good memory; but as that is a gift every one has not from
nature, many methods have been contrived to supply that
defect by art&mdash;the most material of which we shall here
describe.</p>

<p>An artificial memory respects either figures or words;
for the former, let the five vowels, a, e, i, o, u, represent the
first five digits; the diphthongs that begin with the first four
vowels, as au, ea, ie, ou, representing the remaining four
digits, let y stand for an 0, or cypher. Let the ten first
consonants also stand for the nine digits and the cypher, as
in the following table:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="MEMORY">

<p>Then to represent any number, let the first letter be a vowel
or diphthong, the second a consonant, the third a vowel, the
fourth a consonant, &amp;c. Thus for the number 1763, you
write or remember the word <em>akaud</em>; if there are several
sums to be retained, you place the words in form of verses&mdash;which
will make them more pleasing to repeat and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
easy to remember; for example, if you would remember the
dates of the discovery of America by Columbus, the settlement
of Virginia by Captain Smith, the landing of the Pilgrims
at Plymouth, the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Declaration
of Independence, and the Battle of New Orleans, which
were in 1492, 1605, 1620, 1775, 1776, and 1815, you write
as follows&mdash;for you are to observe that in this, as well as
similar cases, when the first figure is always the same, it is
unnecessary to write it after the first time:</p>

<p class="center">Afouc hyh hen keag keah lag.</p>

<p>When several cyphers come together, instead of repeating
y or <em>n</em>, you may write y or <em>n</em> 2, 3, &amp;c.; thus, for 3400, write
<em>ify</em>2, and for 256,000, write <em>ehun</em>3.</p>

<p>To remember any number of words, select the initial
letters of those words, and to the first add a, if it begins
with a consonant, or b, if it begins with a vowel. In like
manner e or c to the second initial letter; to the third add
i or d; to the fourth o or f; to the fifth u or g, so that of
the five initials you make five syllables, which are joined
together in one word&mdash;then of the next five initials you
make, in the same manner, another word, and of every two
words you make a verse; for example, suppose you would
remember the names of all the kings of England since the
Norman conquest in the order in which they reigned, you
then write as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>W<em>a</em> w<em>e</em> h<em>i</em> s<em>o</em> h<em>u</em> <span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span>R<em>a</em> j<em>e</em> h<em>i</em> e<em>f</em> e<em>g</em><br />
E<em>b</em> r<em>e</em> h<em>i</em> h<em>o</em> h<em>u</em> <span class="mleft3b">&nbsp;</span>E<em>b</em> e<em>c</em> r<em>i</em> h<em>o</em> h<em>u</em><br />

<p>Or, if you would remember the letters that begin any number
of verses, suppose the twenty first lines of Pope's Essay
on Man, you write as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>A<em>b</em>t<em>e</em>l<em>i</em>t<em>o</em>e<em>g</em> <span class="mleft3c">&nbsp;</span>A<em>b</em>a<em>c</em>o<em>d</em>t<em>o</em>t<em>u</em><br />

<p class="p6">THE MAGICIAN'S MIRROR.</p>

<p>Construct a box of wood, of a cubical shape, <span class="smcapa">A B C D</span>, of
about fifteen inches every way. Let it be fixed to the pedestal
<span class="smcapa">P</span>, at the usual height of a man's head. In each side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
this box let there be an opening, of
an oval form, ten inches high, and
seven wide. In this box place two
mirrors, <span class="smcapa">A D</span>, with their backs
against each other. Let them cross
the box in a diagonal line, and in
a vertical position. Decorate the
openings in the side of this box
with four oval frames and transparent
glasses, and cover each with
a curtain so contrived as all to
draw up together.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_345a.jpg" width="247" height="287" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Place four persons in front of the
four sides, and at equal distances from the box, and then
draw them up that they may see themselves in the mirrors,
when each of them, instead of his own figure, will see that
of the person next to him, but who will appear to him to be
placed on the opposite side. Their confusion will be the
greater, as it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for them
to discover the mirrors concealed in the box. The reason of
this phenomenon is evident; for though the rays of light
may be turned aside by a mirror, yet they always <em>appear</em> to
proceed in right lines.</p>

darkened. The other part, <span class="smcapa">I B</span>, must be covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
glass, under which is placed a gauze or oiled paper, to prevent
the inside from being seen. Make an aperture at <span class="smcapa">G</span>,
near the top of the side <span class="smcapa">E B</span>, beneath which, on the inside,
place in succession, paintings of vistas, landscapes, figures,

box be placed that the object may be strongly illuminated
by the sun, or by wax-lights placed under the inclosed part
of the box <span class="smcapa">A I</span>. By this simple construction, the objects
placed at <span class="smcapa">G D</span> will be thrown into their natural perspective,

<p>A little instrument has been constructed lately, exhibiting
such remarkable results in connection with rotary motion,
that it has greatly puzzled most of those who have witnessed
its strange performances. Although many of our readers
may have seen the instrument, yet from the numberless inquiries
that have been made for the rationale of its peculiar
feats, and also from the fact that we have not yet heard a
solution that appears to be the true one, we are induced to
furnish a brief description and explanation of the whole.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_346.jpg" width="234" height="222" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It consists of a brass wheel, <span class="smcapa">B</span>, four or five inches in diameter,
with a thick lead rim, or circumference, so as to impart to
the wheel when revolving rapidly
sufficient momentum to cause it to
spin for some minutes. The axis of
this wheel terminates in pivots, set
in a circular ring at right angles to
the wheel, as the figure represents.
Two small flat pieces of brass (<span class="smcapa">A</span>
and <span class="smcapa">C</span>) are soldered outside to
opposite sides of this ring, and a
small cavity is made on the under
side of each piece, so that the
whole may rest on a pointed upright wire, placed in one of
these cavities, this wire being inserted in a heavy metallic
base to give it solidity. A small hole is made in the axis of
the wheel, so that the end of a cord may be thrust through,
the cord wound around it, and rapid motion imparted to
the wheel like the spinning of a top. This constitutes the
whole of the apparatus, which is shown in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>Now, by placing the wheel and its ring, on the upper end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
of the pointed wire, as shown in the figure, <em>only one side being
supported</em>, the wheel and ring would of course, immediately
fall by the force of gravity, there being no support at the
other side, <span class="smcapa">C</span>. But if a rapid spinning motion is given to
the wheel by means of the cord already described, and it be
placed on the point at <span class="smcapa">A</span>, <em>it will not fall</em>, but will move slowly
around on the upright point, performing a steady, revolving
horizontal motion, as long as the rapid rotary motion of the
wheel continues. So steady and uniform is this horizontal
movement, that it generally suggests the motion of the
planets round the sun.</p>

<p>This <em>self-upholding</em> property constitutes the wonder and
puzzle of the instrument, and many explanations have been
attempted. Some ascribe it to atmospheric influence; others
to electricity; while others confidently remark, "Ah, yes,
I understand it&mdash;it is the <em>motion</em> which keeps it from falling&mdash;it
is the momentum&mdash;the centrifugal force;" but <em>why</em> this
result is produced by centrifugal force, we are not told.</p>

<p>The true explanation is this:</p>

<p>1. The wheel when at rest, may of course be easily moved
about so as to alter the position of its axis, in any direction.
But this is not so when it is made to spin rapidly; if the ring
is held in the hands, the wheel will be found strongly to resist
any side or twisting movement&mdash;so much so, that a
novice will start, and almost let it drop, supposing there is
something <em>alive</em> in it or, as they sometimes remark; "Why!
it feels as if there was a <em>snake</em> in the wheel!" This is owing
to nothing but the strong momentum of the <em>lead rim</em> (already
described) tending to keep the wheel in its position; for an
attempt to alter its position, throws all this swiftly flying
matter into a different course, which, it is evident, cannot
easily be done.</p>

<p>2. The <em>slowly revolving</em>, horizontal motion on the pivot at <span class="smcapa">A</span>
is in a contrary direction to the <em>spinning</em> motion of the <em>top</em>
of the wheel, as the arrows show in Fig. 1. In other words,
the forward portion of the wheel flies upwards, and the
back portion downwards. This will be found to be always
the case.</p>

<p>3. Now, when the wheel is moving on horizontally around
the pivot at <em>a</em>, the forward portion of the rim is continually
moving to the <em>left</em>, and the hinder portion to the right, as
represented in Fig. 2. The combined motion of the forward
part of the wheel both upward and to the left, is therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
not perpendicularly upward, but inclined to the left, and the
tendency of its momentum is to throw
the top of the wheel also to the left. In
the same way, the downward momentum
behind throws the bottom to the right.
Throwing the top to the left and the bottom
to the right, of course raises the
wheel as it rests on the pivot <span class="smcapa">A</span>. In
other words, the combined motion of the
wheel on its axis, and on the pivot <span class="smcapa">A</span>,
constantly tends to raise it, thus overcoming gravity, and
maintaining the wheel in its position, supported only at one
end.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/i_348a.jpg" width="175" height="152" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 2</p></div>
</div>

<p>4. The momentum of the lead rim, as described in (1.)
tending to keep the wheel in its position, keeps it also in a
uniformly horizontal attitude; if placed by the hand, inclining
upwards, it will move around on the pivot at <em>a</em>,
without altering this inclination; or the same result takes
place, if inclined below the horizontal.</p>

<p>5. The reason of the forward horizontal movement, is
this: the spinning force of the wheel tends to throw it to
the left, and consequently to lift it upwards, as shown in
(3.)&mdash;gravity, on the opposite hand, tends to draw it downward;
the <em>resultant</em> (or mid-way) motion is therefore between
them, or horzontally. As a proof that gravity thus
produces the onward movement&mdash;when the wheel spins
with the greatest rapidity, and consequently has the greatest
relative force to gravity, the horizontal movement is slowest;
but it continues constantly to increase as the motion of the
wheel is retarded, and as gravity assumes a greater proportionate
force.</p>


<p class="p6">THE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE.</p>

<p>Procure a box, as in cut, of about a foot long, eight inches
wide, and six inches high, or any other dimensions you
please, so they do not greatly vary from these proportions.
At each of its opposite ends, on the inside of this box, place
a piece of looking-glass, that shall exactly fit; but at that
end where the sight hole <span class="smcapa">A</span> is, scrape the quicksilver off the
glass, through which the eye can view the objects.</p>

<p>Cover the box with gauze, over which place a piece of
transparent glass, which is to be well fastened in. Let
there be two grooves at each of the places <span class="smcapa">C D E F</span>, to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
two printed scenes, as follow: On two pieces of pasteboard,
let there be skillfully painted, on both sides, any subject
you think proper, as woods, bowers, gardens, houses,
&amp;c.; and on two other boards, the same subject on one
side only, and cut out all the white parts: observe also,
that there ought to be in one of them some object relative
to the subject, placed at <span class="smcapa">A</span>, that the mirror placed at <span class="smcapa">B</span> may
not reflect the hole on the opposite side.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_349.jpg" width="481" height="243" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The boards painted on both sides are to slide in the
grooves <span class="smcapa">C D E F</span>, and those painted on one side are to be
placed against the opposite mirrors <span class="smcapa">A</span> and <span class="smcapa">B</span>; then cover
the box with its transparent top. This box should be placed
in a strong light, to have a good effect.</p>

<p>When it is viewed through the sight hole, it will present
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and'">an</ins> unlimited prospect of rural scenery, gradually losing
itself in obscurity; and be found well worth the pains bestowed
on its construction.</p>


<p class="p6">EASY AND CURIOUS METHODS OF FORETELLING RAINY OR FINE
WEATHER.</p>

<p>If a line be made of good whipcord, that is well dried,
and a plummet affixed to the end of it, and then hung
against a wainscot, and a line drawn under it, exactly
where the plummet reaches, in very moderate weather it will
be found to rise above it before rain, and to sink below when
the weather is likely to become fair. But the best instrument
of all, is a good pair of scales, in one of which
let there be a brass weight of a pound, and in the other a
pound of salt, or of saltpeter, well dried; a stand being
placed under the scale so as to hinder it falling to low.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
When it is inclined to rain, the salt will swell, and sink the
scale: when the weather is growing fair, the brass weight
will regain its ascendancy.</p>

<p>Another very simple method is, to take a strip of pine
wood, about twenty inches long, one wide, and a quarter
thick, and cut across the grain. Then take a strip of cedar,
of the same dimensions, but cut along the grain. Glue them
firmly face to face, and set them upright in a stand. Some
time before rain falls, the pores of the pine will absorb
moisture from the atmosphere, and swell until the whole
forms a bow, which will straighten itself as fine weather
approaches. It is needless to say that the rods should not
be painted or varnished.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MAGICAL MEASURE.</p>

<p>The line to be measured must not be extravagantly long,
otherwise it will be difficult to measure it accurately; for
the least failure of a just aim, or departure from an upright
position, would make very sensible errors in the measure
of a very long line, especially if the ground was very uneven.
To measure then the line <span class="smcapa">A B</span>, accessible at the
extremity <span class="smcapa">A</span>, suppose the breadth of a small river, he who
pretends to measure must stand very straight at the extremity
<span class="smcapa">A</span>, and support his chin with a little stick resting upon
one of the buttons of his coat, so as to keep his head steady
in one position. He must pull his hat down upon his forehead
till the brim of his hat covers from his view the inaccessible
extremity <span class="smcapa">B</span> of the line to be measured <span class="smcapa">A B</span>, then he
must turn himself to a level, uniform piece of ground, and
with the same position of his hat, observe the point of the
ground where his view terminates, as <span class="smcapa">C</span>, then measuring
with a line or chain the distance <span class="smcapa">A C</span>, he has the length of
the line proposed <span class="smcapa">A B</span>.</p>

<p class="p6">THE BOUNDLESS PROSPECT.</p>

<p>Take a square box, about six inches long and twelve high,
or of any other proportionate dimensions. Cover the inside
with four flat pieces of looking glass placed perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
to the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'flottom'">bottom</ins> of the box. Place at the bottom any objects
you please, as a piece of fortification, a castle, tents, soldiers,
&amp;c. On the top, place a frame of glass shaped like
the bottom of a pyramid, as in the figure, and so formed as
to fit on the box like a cover. The four sides of this cover
are to be composed of ground glass, or covered inside with
gauze, so that the light may enter, and yet the inside be
invisible, except at the top, which must be covered with
transparent glass: when you look through this glass, the
inside will present a pleasing prospect of a boundless extent;
and, if managed with care, will afford a deal of
amusement.</p>

<p class="p6">THE HOUR OF THE DAY OR NIGHT TOLD BY A SUSPENDED SHILLING.</p>

<p>However improbable the following experiment may appear,
it has been proved by repeated trials:</p>

<p>Sling a shilling or sixpence at the end of a piece of thread
by means of a loop. Then resting your elbow on a table,
hold the other end of the thread betwixt your fore finger and
thumb, observing to let it pass across the ball of the thumb,
and thus suspend the shilling into an empty goblet. Observe,
your hand must be perfectly steady; and if you find
it difficult to keep it in an immovable posture, it is useless
to attempt the experiment. Premising, however, that the
shilling is properly suspended, you will observe, that when
it has recovered its equilibrium, it will for a moment be
stationary: it will then of its own accord, and without the
least agency from the person holding it, assume the action
of a pendulum, vibrating from side to side of the glass, and,
after a few seconds, will strike the hour nearest to the time
of day; for instance, if the time be twenty-five minutes past
six, it will strike six; if thirty-five minutes past six, it will
strike seven; and so on of any other hour.</p>

<p>It is necessary to observe, that the thread should lie over
the pulse of the thumb, and this may in some measure account
for the <em>vibration</em> of the shilling; but to what cause its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
striking the precise hour is to be traced, remains unexplained;
for it is no less astonishing than true, that when
it has struck the proper number, its vibration ceases, it
acquires a kind of rotary motion, and at last becomes stationary,
as before.</p>


<p class="p6">CONTRIVANCE FOR A WATCH LAMP, PERFECTLY SAFE, WHICH WILL
SHOW THE HOUR OF THE NIGHT, WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE, TO A PERSON
LYING IN BED.</p>

<p>It consists of a stand, with three claws, the pillar of which
is made hollow, for the purpose of receiving a water candlestick
of an inch diameter. On the top of the pillar, by
means of two hinges and a bolt, is fixed on a small proportionate
table, a box of six sides, lined with brass, tin, or
any shining metal, nine inches deep, and six inches in diameter.
In the center of one of these sides is fixed a lens,
double convex, of at least three inches and a half diameter.
The center of the side directly opposite to the lens is perforated
so as to receive the dial-plate of the watch, the body
of which is confined on the outside, by means of a hollow
slide. When the box is lighted by a common watch-light,
the figures are magnified nearly to the size of those of an
ordinary clock.</p>


<p class="p6">THE ENCHANTED PALACE.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 219px;">
<img src="images/i_352.jpg" width="219" height="421" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On the six-sided plane <span class="smcapa">A B C D E F</span>
of the figure, draw six semi-diameters;
and on each of these place
perpendicularly two plane mirrors,
which must join exactly at the center,
and which, placed back to back,
must be thin as possible. Decorate
the exterior boundary of this piece,
(which is at the extremity of the
angles of the hexagon,) with six
columns, that at the same time serve
to support the mirrors by grooves
formed on their inner sides. Add to
these columns their entablatures,
and cover the edifice in whatever
manner you please. In each one of
these six triangular spaces, contained
between two mirrors, place little
figures of pasteboard, in relief, representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
such subjects, as when seen in an hexagonal form,
will produce an agreeable effect. To these add small figures
of enamel, and take particular care to conceal by some object
that has no relation to the subject, the place where the
mirrors join, which, as before observed, all meet in the
common center.</p>

<p>When you look into any one of the six openings of this
palace, the objects there contained, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'beng'">being</ins> reflected six
times, will seem entirely to fill up the whole of the building.
This illusion will appear very remarkable, especially if the
objects chosen are properly adapted to the effect which the
mirrors are intended to produce.</p>

<p>If you place between two of these mirrors part of a fortification,
as a curtain, and two demi-bastions, you will see
an entire citadel with six bastions; or if you place part of
a ball-room, ornamented with chandeliers and figures, all
these objects being here <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'mithltiplied'">multiplied</ins>, will afford a very
pleasing prospect.</p>


<p class="p6">TO KNOW WHICH OF TWO DIFFERENT WATERS IS THE LIGHTEST WITHOUT
ANY SCALES.</p>

<p>Take a solid body, the specific gravity of which is less
than that of water, pine, or fir wood, for instance, and put
it into each of the two waters, and rest assured that it will
sink deeper in the lighter than in the heavier water; and
so by observing the difference of the sinking, you will
know which is the lightest water, and consequently the
most wholesome for drinking.</p>


<p class="p6">TO KNOW IF A SUSPICIOUS PIECE OF MONEY IS GOOD OR BAD.</p>

<p>If it be a piece of silver that is not very thick, as a dollar
or a half dollar, the goodness of which you want to try,
take another piece of good silver of equal balance with it,
and tie both pieces with thread or horse-hair to the scales
of an exact balance (to avoid the wetting of the scales
themselves) and dip the two pieces thus tied in water; for
then, if they are of equal goodness, that is, of equal purity,
they will hang in equilibrio in the water as well as in the
air; but if the piece in question is lighter in the water than
the other, it is certainly false, that is, there is some other
metal mixed with it that has less specific gravity than
silver, such as copper. If it is heavier than the other, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
likewise bad, as being mixed with a metal of greater specific
gravity than silver, such as lead.</p>

<p>If the piece proposed is very thick, such as that crown
of gold that Hiero, king of Syracuse, sent to Archimedes
to know if the goldsmith had put into it all the eighteen
pounds of gold that he had given him for that end, take a
piece of pure gold of equal weight with the crown proposed,
viz., eighteen pounds, and without taking the trouble
of weighing them in water, put them into a vessel full of
water, one after another, and that which drives out most
water must necessarily be mixed with another metal of less
specific gravity than gold, as taking up more space, though
of equal weight.</p>


<p class="p6">PYRAMID OF ALUM.</p>

<p>Put a lump of alum into a tumbler of water, and as the
alum dissolves it will assume the shape of a pyramid. The
cause of the alum decreasing in this peculiar form is
briefly as follows: at first, the water dissolves the alum
very fast, but as the alum becomes united with the water,
the solvent power of the latter diminishes. The water,
which combines first with the alum, becomes heavier by the
union, and falls to the bottom of the glass, where it ceases
to dissolve any more, although the water which it has displaced
from the bottom has risen to the top of the glass,
and is there acting upon the alum. When the solution has
nearly terminated, if you closely examine the lump, you will
find it covered with geometrical figures, cut out, as it were,
in relief upon the mass; showing, not only that the cohesion
of the atoms of the alum resists the power of solution in
the water, but that, in the present instance, it resists it more
in some directions than in others. Indeed, this experiment
beautifully illustrates the opposite action of cohesion and
solution.</p>


<p class="p6">THE DANCING AUTOMATON.</p>

<p>Procure a piece of silk thread about six feet long, and
fasten a small wire hook at one end, and a fine needle at
the other, then make a knot in the thread about ten inches
from the end upon which the hook is fastened. You also
procure a small pasteboard figure about four inches long,
and pierce a hole through the center of the same just large
enough to easily admit the needle. Having done this, take
a convenient opportunity and fasten the hook in the carpet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
about five and a half feet from the chair upon which you
intend to sit while performing the trick. You then can inform
your audience that you intend to make the figure
dance and keep time to any tune they may name. You
then slip the needle through the hole in the figure and
throw it down on the floor, with sufficient force to make it
slip on the thread until it reaches the knot, being careful to
retain the needle still in your hand, then whistle any air
the company may suggest, and appear to beat time with
your hands upon your knees. This will make the figure
dance, to the great astonishment of the spectators. After
you have continued this for a few minutes, you must drop
the needle and pick up the figure, when the needle will
again slide through the hole in the figure, and the automaton
being free from the thread, you can hand it to the
audience for examination. This is an excellent trick for
the parlor, and, if well performed, will defy detection.</p>


<p class="p6">TO MELT A PIECE OF MONEY IN A WALNUT SHELL, WITHOUT INJURING
THE SHELL.</p>

<p>Bend any thin coin, and put it into half a walnut shell;
place the shell on a little sand, to keep it steady. Then
fill the shell with a mixture made of three parts of very dry
pounded niter, one part of flowers of sulphur, and a little
sawdust well sifted. If you then set light to the mixture,
you will find, when it is melted, that the metal will also
be melted at the bottom of the shell, in form of a button,
which will become hard when the burning matter round
it is consumed: the shell will have sustained very little
injury.</p>


<p class="p6">THE INVISIBLE SPRINGS.</p>

<p>Take two pieces of white cotton <em>cord</em>, precisely alike in
length; double each of them separately, so that their ends
meet; then tie them together very neatly, with a bit of fine
cotton <em>thread</em>, at the part where they double (<em>i. e.</em> the middle).
This must all be done beforehand. When you are
going to exhibit the trick, hand round two other pieces of
cord, exactly similar in length and appearance to those
which you have prepared, but not tied, and desire your company
to examine them. You then return to your table, placing
these cords at the edge, so that they fall (apparently
accidentally) to the ground, behind the table; stoop to pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
them up, but take up the prepared ones instead, which you
had previously placed there, and lay <em>them</em> on the table. You
then take round for examination three ivory rings; those
given to children when teething, and which may be had at
any of the toyshops, are the best for your purpose. When
the rings have undergone a sufficient scrutiny, pass the prepared
double cords through them, and give the two ends of
one cord to one person to hold, and the two ends of the
other to another. Do not let them pull hard, or the thread
will break, and your trick be discovered. Request the two
persons to approach each other, and desire each to give you
one end of the cord which he holds, leaving to him the choice.</p>

<p>You then say that, to make all fast, you will tie these two
ends together, which you do, bringing the knot down so as
to touch the rings; and returning to each person the end
of the cord next to him, you state that this trick is performed
by the rule of contrary, and that when you desire
them to pull hard, they are to slacken, and <em>vice versa</em>, which
is likely to create much laughter, as they are certain to
make many mistakes at first. During this time you are
holding the rings on the fore fingers of each hand, and with
the other fingers preventing your assistants from separating
the cords prematurely, during their mistakes; you at length
desire them, in a loud voice, to slack, when they will pull
hard, which will break the thread, the rings remaining in
your hands, whilst the strings will remain unbroken: let
them be again examined, and desire them to look for the
springs in the rings.</p>


<p class="p6">THE FLIGHT OF THE RING.</p>

<p>You may cause a ring to shift from one hand to another
and make it go on any finger required on the other hand,
while somebody holds both your arms, in order to prevent
communication between them, by attending to these instructions:
Desire some lady in company to lend you a
gold ring, recommending her at the same time to make a
mark on it, that she may know it again. Have a gold ring
of your own. which fasten by a small piece of catgut string
to a watch barrel, and sew it to the left sleeve of your coat.
Take the ring that is given you in your right hand; then
putting, with dexterity, the other ring fastened to the
watch-barrel near the entrance of your sleeve, draw it privately
to the fingers' ends of your left hand. During this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
operation, hide the ring that has been lent you between the
fingers of your right hand, and fasten it dexterously on a
little hook sewed for the purpose, on your waistcoat, and
hidden by your coat. After that, show your ring, which
hold in your left hand; then ask the company on which
finger of the other hand they wish it to pass. During this
interval, and as soon as the answer has been given, put
the before mentioned finger on the little hook, in order to
slip the ring on it: at that moment let go the other ring, by
opening your fingers. The spring which is in the watch-barrel,
being confined no longer, will contract, and make the
ring slip under the sleeve, without any body perceiving it,
not even those who hold your arms, as their attention will
be occupied to prevent your hands from communicating.
After this operation, show the assembly that the ring is
come on the other hand, and make them remark that it is
the same that had been lent to you, or that the mark is right.
Much dexterity is required in this trick, so that the deception
may not be suspected.</p>


<p class="p6">MUSICAL FIGURES RESULTING FROM SOUND.</p>

<p>Cover the mouth of a wine glass, having a foot-stalk, with
a thin sheet of membrane, over which scatter a layer of fine
sand. The vibrations excited in the air by the sound of a
musical instrument, held within a few inches of the membrane,
will cause the sand on its surface to form regular
lines and figures with astonishing celerity, which vary with
the sound produced.</p>


<p class="p6">TO MAKE A CARD JUMP OUT OF THE PACK.</p>

<p>Let any person draw a card, and afterwards put it into
the pack, but take care that you know where to find it
at pleasure. This you may do by having <em>forced</em> it. Then
put a piece of wax under the thumb-nail of your right hand,
and fasten a hair by it to your thumb, and the other end of the
hair, by the same means, to the card chosen: spread the
pack upon the table, and, making use of any words you
think fit, make it jump from the pack about the table.</p>


<p class="p6">THE TELL-TALE CARDS.</p>

<p>Tell any one to shuffle the pack, to take off the upper card,
and to notice it, then to lay it on the table, with its face downward,
and put so many cards upon it as will make up thirteen
with the number of spots on the noted card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>For instance: if the card which the person first looked at
was a king, queen, knave, or ten, bid him lay that card with
its face downward, calling it ten; upon that let him lay
another, calling it eleven; upon that, another, calling it
twelve; and upon that, another, calling it thirteen; then
bid him take off the next uppermost card: suppose it to be
an eight, let him lay it down on another part of the table,
calling it eight; upon the latter another, calling it nine, and
so on in the same way, until he makes that heap up to thirteen;
then let him go to the next uppermost card, and so proceed
to lay out the third parcel in the same way as the two
preceding, and should the uppermost card be an ace, he
must lay it down, calling it one, the next two, &amp;c.</p>

<p>All this should be done either while you are out of the
room, or your back is turned; upon your turning round, you
take the cards which have been left; your object being to
count, without its being perceived, how many there are remaining,
you throw aside the three top cards, and lay the
next three on the table, with their faces upward; then throw
away one, then turn up one, and so on in the same way, until
you ascertain how many cards they are; we will suppose
that you find twenty-five cards left; deduct ten, when the
remaining fifteen will be the number of all the spots contained
in all the bottom cards of the three heaps, counting
the court cards as ten; you must recollect that ten is, in all
cases, the number to be deducted from the cards remaining.
Having found that fifteen is the number of spots on the
cards, do not declare it at once; but select from those cards
which lie on the table, face uppermost, three or four which
added together will make fifteen.</p>

<p>For instance: should there be a deuce, a five, and an eight,
lay them aside for a moment, and taking the other cards
from which you selected the three, put them along with those
which you previously rejected; you now hand the three telltale
cards to any person, assuring him that the number of
pips on those cards will be the same as those on the bottom
cards of the three heaps, which will be found to be the case.</p>


<p class="p6">THE DOUBLE DOZEN.</p>

<p>Present a pack of cards to one of the company, desiring
him to shuffle them well, and to get them shuffled by whomsoever
he pleases; then make several persons cut them;
after which you will propose to one of the company to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the pack and think of a card, and remember it, and likewise
its order in the pack, by counting one, two, three, four, &amp;c.,
till he comes, exclusively, to the one thought of; offer to go
into another room, or to be blindfolded, while he is doing
this. Now declare in what order the card shall be in the
pack; say, for instance the twenty-fourth; and, by attending
to the following instructions, it will prove to be so:&mdash;Suppose
the person who thinks of the card stops at thirteen,
and that the thirteenth card was the queen of hearts, the
number you have stated it shall be in the pack being twenty-four;
you return to the room, in case you had left it, or desire
the handkerchief to be removed, if you have been blindfolded;
and, without asking any question of the person who
has thought of the card, ask only for the pack, and apply it
to your nose, as if to smell it; then passing it behind your
back, or under the table, take, from the bottom of the pack,
twenty-three cards; that is to say, one less than the number
you have stated the card thought of shall be; place these
twenty-three cards on the top. This being done, return the
pack to the person who had thought of the card, requesting
him to reckon the cards from the top of the pack, beginning
by the number of the card he thought of. His card being
the thirteenth, he will be compelled to count fourteen, and
you are to stop him when he comes to twenty-three, reminding
him that the number you have mentioned is twenty-four,
and that, consequently, the twenty-fourth card, which he is
going to take up, will be the card thought of; and so it
will most certainly be.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>


<p class="p6">THE HOUSEBREAKERS.</p>

<p>Take a pack of cards, and place all the aces together, the
twos, the threes, and so on up to the kings. There will then
be thirteen different heaps. You say, "Here are four houses
(laying down the four aces separately), which four knaves
enter for the purpose of robbing (laying a knave upon each
ace), and take with them their implements for housebreaking
(and upon each of the knaves you lay a two, three, four,
five, six, seven, and eight). The mistresses of the houses
come home (laying a queen upon each of the heaps), bringing
their money with them (laying a nine upon each queen).
Shortly after, their husbands also return (laying a king upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
each queen), also bringing money with them" (laying a
ten upon each heap). You have now disposed of all the
cards, which form four distinct heaps. Then lay one heap
over the other, and let as many persons cut them as please.
When this is done, if you commence at the top of the pack,
and lay the cards face downwards, one by one, so as to make
thirteen separate heaps, you will find all the aces together,
the twos, and so on, as you originally placed them.</p>


<p class="p6">THE MAGIC BOOK.</p>

<p>Provide an octavo book of plain paper, of whatever thickness
you please. Turn over seven leaves from the beginning,
and paint a group of flowers; then turn over seven
more leaves, and paint the same again, and so on, until you
have turned the book through to the end. Then paste a slip
of paper or parchment to each of the painted leaves. Turn
the book over again, and paint upon every sixth leaf a parrot,
and then paste strips upon them as you did upon the
first, only a little lower down. Proceed in this manner until
you have painted the book full of pictures of various sorts,
taking care one side of the leaves is left white paper. When
you use the book, hold it in your left hand, and set the thumb
of your right hand upon the first of the parchment stays;
run the book through, and it will appear full of flowers;
then stop and, blowing upon the book, run it through again,
with the thumb upon the second slips of parchment, and it
will, appear full of parrots. Afterwards, reverse the book,
and run it through as before, and it will appear composed
of blank paper.</p>


<p class="p6">THE TAPE TRICK.</p>

<p>This trick consists in suffering a person to tie your thumbs
together tightly, and yet that you shall be able to release
them in a moment, and tie them together again. The mode
of performing this trick is as follows:&mdash;Lay a piece of tape
across the palms of your hands, placed side by side, letting
the ends hang down; then bring your palms quickly
together, at the same time privately catching hold of the
middle of the tape with your fourth and fifth fingers. Then
direct any person to tie your thumbs together as tight as he
pleases, but he will not, of course, in reality be tying them,
because you have hold of the tape, yet it will nevertheless
appear to him that he is doing so. Request him to place a
hat over your hands; then blow upon the hat, and say, "Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
loose," slipping your thumbs from under the tape; direct
him to remove the hat, and show your thumbs free. You
then request the hat may again be placed over your hands,
and blowing upon it, you say "Be tied," slipping your
thumbs under the tape again; and when the hat is removed,
your thumbs will appear tied as at first. After performing
the trick, convey the tape away, lest it be detected.</p>


<p class="p6">MORE THAN FULL.</p>

<p>Fill a glass to the brim with water, and you may add to
it spirit of wine without causing the water to overflow.</p>


<p class="p6">FLOATING NEEDLES.</p>

<p>Fill a cup with water, gently lay on its surface small fine
needles, and they will float.</p>


<p class="p6">THE KNOTTED THREAD.</p>

<p>Considerable amusement, not unmixed with wonder,
may be occasioned among a party of ladies, by a clever
performance of this trick. It is most frequently performed
by a female, but the effect of it is considerably increased
when it is displayed by a youth. A piece of calico, muslin,
or linen, is taken in the left hand, a needle is threaded in
the presence of the spectators, and the usual, or even a
double or treble knot, made at the extremity of one of the
ends of it. The operator commences his work by drawing
the needle and the thread in it quite through the linen, notwithstanding
the knot, and continues to make several
stitches in like manner successively.</p>

<p>The mode of performing this seeming wonder is as follows:
A bit of thread, about a quarter of a yard long, is
turned once round the top of the middle finger of the right
hand, upon which a thimble is then placed, to keep it secure.
This must be done privately, and the thread kept concealed,
while a needle is threaded with a bit of thread of a similar
length. The thread in the needle must have one of its ends
drawn up nearly close, and be concealed between the forefinger
and thumb; the other should hang down nearly as long
as, and by the side of the thread, which is fastened under the
thimble, so that these two may appear to be the two ends of
the thread. The end of the piece that is fastened under the
thimble is then knotted, and the performer begins to sew,
by moving his hand quickly after he has taken up the stitch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
It will appear as though he actually passed the knotted
thread through the cloth.</p>


<p class="p6">THE BACCHUS EXPERIMENT.</p>

<p>This experiment, showing the elasticity of air, is performed
with a pleasing toy. It represents a figure of Bacchus
sitting across a cask, in which are two separate compartments.
Put into one of them a portion of wine or
colored liquid, and place the apparatus under the exhausted
receiver of an air-pump, when the elastic force of the confined
air will cause the liquid to ascend a transparent glass
tube (fitted on purpose), into the mouth of the Bacchanalian
figure. To render the experiment more striking, a bladder,
with a small quantity of air therein, is fastened around the
figure, and covered with a loose silken robe, when the air
in the bladder will expand, and produce an apparent increase
in the bulk of the figure, as if occasioned by the excess of
liquor drunk.</p>


<p class="p6">CURIOUS METHOD OF MEASURING THE HEIGHT OF A TREE.</p>

<p>To ascertain the height of an object a peculiar method of
measurement is in use among the Isthmus Indians. In
measuring the height of a tree, for instance, a man proceeds
from its base to a point where, on turning the back towards
it, and putting the head between the legs, he can just see
the top; at the spot where he is able to do this he makes a
mark on the ground to the base of the tree; this distance
will be equal to the height.</p>


<p class="p6">THE TRANSPOSABLE PIECES.</p>

<p>Take two quarter eagles and two dimes, and grind part
of them away, on one side only, so that they may be but
half the common thickness; and observe, that they must be
quite thin at the edge; then rivet a quarter eagle and a
dime together. Lay one of these double pieces, with the
dime upwards, on the palm of your hand, at the bottom of
your three first fingers, and lay the other piece with the
quarter eagle upwards in like manner, in the other hand.
Let the company take notice in which hand is the quarter
eagle, and in which is the dime. Then, as you shut your
hands, you naturally turn the pieces over, and when you
open them again, the dime and the quarter eagle will appear
to have changed their places.</p>
